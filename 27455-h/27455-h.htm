<p style='font-size:1.2em;'>FOREWORD</p>
<p style='font-variant:small-caps;'>By Jack Binns</p>
</div>

<p>Since this volume was written an epoch making
invention has been announced to the radio
world. It is the super-regenerative system developed
by E. H. Armstrong, the wizard of
Columbia University. This system is bound to
revolutionize the art of wireless communication
in every branch, and is in itself the most important
discovery since Marconi put into operation
the first crude form of wireless apparatus.</p>
<p>I am mentioning this fact because there is the
romance of youth overcoming every obstacle
placed before it tied up in the history of Armstrong&#8217;s
remarkable achievements, and the story
of this romance should stand forward as an incentive
to American boyhood.</p>
<p>Fifteen years ago when radio amateurs first
began to send out wireless telegraph messages,
the federal authorities in Washington were at a
loss to devise some means that would regulate
them. It was then that a bright official conversant
with radio said: &#8220;Put &#8217;em down below
200 meters, and they&#8217;ll soon die out.&#8221;</p>
<p>He knew perfectly well that it was almost impossible
to operate on those low wave-lengths
with the apparatus in existence at that time&mdash;hence
his sardonic proposal. The amateurs,
however, refused to &#8220;die out.&#8221; Faced with the
inexorable regulation, they set to work to devise
apparatus which would operate successfully.
Among them was E. H. Armstrong, a youth who
at that time was attending Columbia.</p>
<p>It was a really lucky thing for the world that
the official in Washington thought of his clever
scheme to kill the amateurs, because it provided
just the incentive needed to set Armstrong to
work. The result has been that within ten years
he has produced three epoch-making inventions,
any one of which would have been a remarkable
life achievement in itself.</p>
<p>Such, briefly is the story of one radio boy
overcoming difficulties, but of course in this case
it is a real story. It emphasizes the fact that
even in these highly developed and organized
times there is always an opportunity for boys to
improve upon existing conditions, and since this
is the theme of the adventures of &#8220;The Radio
Boys,&#8221; I am very glad to write the foreword to
the series.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>THE COLLISION</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it a grand and glorious feeling?&#8221; exclaimed
Bob Layton, a tall stalwart lad of fifteen,
as he stretched himself out luxuriously on
the warm sands of the beach at Ocean Point and
pulled his cap a little further over his eyes to
keep out the rays of the sun.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell the world it is,&#8221; agreed Joe Atwood,
his special chum, as he burrowed lazily into the
hollow he had scooped out for himself. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t have to put up any argument to prove it,
Bob. I admit it from the start.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Same here,&#8221; chimed in Herb Fennington,
sprawled out in a fashion which if certainly inelegant
was quite as certainly comfortable.
&#8220;Take it from me, it&#8217;s great. I could die loafing
like this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems to be unanimous,&#8221; remarked Bob, &#8220;although
I haven&#8217;t heard Jimmy&#8217;s musical voice
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
mixing into the conversation and he&#8217;s usually
right there with the talk. I wonder&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>Just then he was interrupted by a vigorous
snore proceeding from a fourth member of the
group, a fat round-faced boy slightly younger
than the others, who was lying on his back a
few feet away.</p>
<p>The boys broke into a laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the answer,&#8221; chuckled Herb. &#8220;Trust
Jimmy to go to sleep on the slightest provocation.
There&#8217;s only one thing he can do better,
and that is eating.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He sure is no slouch at either,&#8221; laughed Joe.
&#8220;The seven sleepers of Ephesus had nothing on
Jimmy. And if he went into a doughnut-eating
contest, I&#8217;d back him to my last dime.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no wonder that&#8217;s he&#8217;s tired,&#8221; said Bob,
coming to the defense of the unconscious Jimmy.
&#8220;If either of you fellows had had the tussle he
had with the waves that night when he was hanging
on to the broken bridge expecting every
minute to be his last, you wouldn&#8217;t be feeling any
too lively, you can bet your boots.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right you are,&#8221; admitted Herb. &#8220;That was
a tough fight. It makes the cold chills run up
and down my back now when I think of it. I
don&#8217;t think there&#8217;ll be many times in Jimmy&#8217;s
life when he&#8217;ll come so near death and yet side-step
it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You were pretty close to it yourself, Bob,&#8221;
put in Joe. &#8220;Your chances of getting by didn&#8217;t
seem to be worth a plugged nickel. Of course
you&#8217;re stronger than Jimmy and could have kept
up longer if you&#8217;d been swept away, but I don&#8217;t
believe there&#8217;s any one living that could have
bucked that torrent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll admit that I felt mighty good when I
got my feet on solid ground again,&#8221; said Bob.
&#8220;There&#8217;s no denying that that was a pretty strenuous
night, what with fighting the waves and
Dan Cassey too. But we beat them both and
came through all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Talking of Cassey,&#8221; said Joe, &#8220;I saw the
rascal this morning when I went into the town
to attend to a little business for my father. I
wasn&#8217;t far from the jail and I dropped in to see
just what arrangements had been made for his
trial. The warden was glad to see me&mdash;you
know he&#8217;s been pretty strong for us since we
saved the police the work of getting their claws
on Cassey&mdash;and as he was just about to make
the rounds he asked me to go along. So I had
a chance to see Cassey behind the bars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose he was glad to see you?&#8221; remarked
Bob, with a grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tickled to death,&#8221; laughed Joe. &#8220;I&#8217;m just as
popular with him as poison ivy. He got just
purple with rage and shook the bars of his cell
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
as though he were trying to break them to get
at me. He tried to tell me what he thought of
me, but he stuttered so much that he couldn&#8217;t get
it out. I suppose he&#8217;s stuttering yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not surprising that he&#8217;s sore at us,&#8221; said
Bob. &#8220;That&#8217;s twice we&#8217;ve put a spoke in his
wheel; once when he tried to swindle Miss Berwick
in the matter of that mortgage and again
when he blackjacked Harvey and looted his safe.
We sure have been a jinx for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And he isn&#8217;t the only one who has it in for
us,&#8221; said Joe, as he caught sight of three boys
of about their own age who were passing by, and
who in passing cast looks of dislike on the little
group on the sands. &#8220;There&#8217;s a sweet bunch&mdash;I
don&#8217;t think.&#8221;</p>
<p>The others followed the direction of Joe&#8217;s
glance and had no trouble in agreeing with him.</p>
<p>&#8220;That Buck Looker is sure bad medicine,&#8221; remarked
Bob. &#8220;And Lutz and Mooney who hang
out with him are just about as bad. They&#8217;re
all tarred with the same brush.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re a blot on the landscape&mdash;or perhaps
I should say seascape,&#8221; put in Herb.</p>

<p>chanted Joe. &#8220;Do you notice how everybody
steers clear of them? Outside of each other, not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
one of them has a friend in the whole colony.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a wonder we haven&#8217;t had a run in with
them before this,&#8221; ruminated Herb.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess Buck doesn&#8217;t want any of our game,&#8221;
Joe rejoined. &#8220;He&#8217;s already had one licking from
Bob, and it was only the butting in of Mr. Preston
that saved him from getting another one
from me. But I have a hunch that he&#8217;ll get it
yet. My knuckles are itching, and that&#8217;s a bad
sign&mdash;for Buck.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll get the chance all right,&#8221; predicted
Herb. &#8220;Ten to one they&#8217;re framing up some
low-down game to play on us whenever they find
an opening. Maybe they&#8217;ll try to put our radio
set out of commission, just as they stole Jimmy&#8217;s
set and tried to wreck Bob&#8217;s aerial.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re welcome to try,&#8221; said Bob carelessly.
&#8220;Though they ought to be cured of that idea
when they remember how they flivvered the other
times. But talking of radio reminds me that we
ought to get busy with that lightning arrester we
were talking about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What has lightning done that it ought to be
arrested?&#8221; joked Herb.</p>
<p>For answer, Bob scooped up a handful of sand
and threw it at the scoffer. Herb ducked
adroitly and the sand passed over his head and
fell full on Jimmy&#8217;s mouth, which at the moment
happened to be open.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span></p>
<p>There was a terrific coughing and sputtering,
as Jimmy came up to a sitting posture with a
quickness that was quite foreign to his nature.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&mdash;who the mischief did that?&#8221; he demanded,
as soon as he could speak, glaring indignantly
from one to the other of his comrades,
who at first had been alarmed for fear he would
choke but now were convulsed with laughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;I did,&#8221; confessed Bob, as he tried to restrain
his untimely mirth. &#8220;But I didn&#8217;t mean to, old
scout. Herb here had just gotten off one of his
horrible jokes, and I was trying to make the punishment
fit the crime. I&#8217;m awfully sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You look it,&#8221; snorted Jimmy, still trying to
get the remainder of the sand out of his mouth.
&#8220;You look as though your heart was broken,
sitting there and grinning like a monkey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cross my heart and hope to die, I didn&#8217;t mean
to,&#8221; declared Bob. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t have disturbed
your innocent slumbers for anything in the
world.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, Jimmy,&#8221; put in Herb. &#8220;They
say that every one has got to eat a peck of dirt
before they die, and you might as well start in
early.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I got my whole peck then,&#8221; grumbled
Jimmy, as he rubbed his mouth vigorously
with his handkerchief. &#8220;I feel like a chicken
with sand in its craw.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You ought to feel pretty good then,&#8221; replied
Herb, &#8220;for they eat it because they like it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the cause of it all,&#8221; said Jimmy.
&#8220;When you try to be funny again, do it when
I&#8217;m not around. I&#8217;ll bet the joke was a rotten
one, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I tell it to you?&#8221; asked Herb hopefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not unless you&#8217;re prepared to die,&#8221; replied
Jimmy, and Herb forebore to add insult to injury.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now as to this lightning arrester,&#8221; resumed
Bob, leaving Jimmy to regain his equanimity.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to put it up, for the regulations require
it and we ought to have done it before.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jimmy pricked up his ears but said nothing.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s really much need of it,&#8221;
objected Joe. &#8220;It&#8217;s too nice an afternoon to
work. We&#8217;ve got a lightning rod on the cottage
anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t so much for the cottage as the set,&#8221;
said Bob. &#8220;If the lightning got into the receiving
set it would make short work of it. Now
here&#8217;s the kind of lightning switch we&#8217;ll have to
have,&#8221; and he launched into an earnest discussion
of a type that was required by the radio regulations.</p>
<p>Jimmy took no part in the discussions, but they
attributed this to a touch of grouchiness and gave
him time to get over it. Bob after a while
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
glanced at him, and saw that he wore a broad
grin on his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the joke, Jimmy?&#8221; he asked, a little
suspiciously.</p>
<p>For only answer Jimmy broke into a peal of
laughter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of all the boobs,&#8221; he chortled.</p>
<p>They looked at him and then at each other in
bewilderment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think the sun has affected his brain?&#8221;
asked Herb, with affected anxiety.</p>
<p>&#8220;It might have, if he had any brain to be affected,&#8221;
replied Joe, in the same strain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us in on it, Jimmy,&#8221; pleaded Bob. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
be selfish and keep it all to yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you thick heads,&#8221; replied Jimmy, with
more force than politeness, &#8220;don&#8217;t you know that
you don&#8217;t have to have a lightning arrester with
a loop aerial?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was a moment&#8217;s silence while they let
this sink in, and then a sheepish grin stole into
their faces.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure enough,&#8221; owned up Bob. &#8220;I knew that
too, but I had forgotten it for the time. I was
thinking of the outdoor aerial. Of course on an
indoor aerial there&#8217;s no need of a lightning arrester.
Jimmy, I take off my hat to you. As
the leader of the lynching party said to the widow,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
after they had lynched the wrong man, the joke&#8217;s
on us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess that evens things up,&#8221; crowed Jimmy
gleefully, his usual good-humor completely restored.
&#8220;To think of all that waste of good chin
music over nothing,&#8221; he added mockingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t rub it in,&#8221; admonished Joe. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
admit that we&#8217;re boobs and let it go at that.
Serves us right for thinking of working on a
day like this, anyway. Those people out there
have the right idea,&#8221; he continued, pointing to a
party in a rowboat some distance out from the
shore.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wish we were out there with them,&#8221; remarked
Herb enviously, as his eyes followed the boat,
which had in it three persons, two boys and a
girl.</p>
<p>&#8220;A sailboat would be good enough for me,&#8221;
put in Jimmy. &#8220;Rowing is too much like work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or better yet a motor boat like that one coming
over from the right,&#8221; said Herb. &#8220;In that
thing the engine does all the work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Those fellows in the rowboat seem to be
laboring pretty hard at the oars,&#8221; remarked Bob.
&#8220;They don&#8217;t seem to be any too expert, and the
waves are pretty rough since that wind sprang
up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The reason they&#8217;re pulling so hard is to get
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
out of the way of that motor boat,&#8221; declared Joe.
&#8220;It looks almost as though they were going to
run them down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There wouldn&#8217;t be any excuse for that with
the whole broad ocean to maneuver in,&#8221; commented
Bob. &#8220;But, Great Scott!&#8221; he cried,
jumping to his feet. &#8220;That&#8217;s just exactly what
it&#8217;s doing. Look! It&#8217;s right on top of them!&#8221;</p>
<p>The four boys watched with breathless interest
the unfolding before their eyes of what promised
to be a tragedy.</p>
<p>The young men in the smaller boat were pulling
like mad to get out of the way of the motor
boat bearing down upon them with undiminished
speed. The girl in the stern of the boat was
wringing her hands and screaming.</p>
<p>Whether the two men in the motor boat failed
to see the rowboat in their path, or whether they
were simply reckless and heartless, it was impossible
to tell. In any event, there was no shifting
of the helm, no slackening of speed. Swift
and relentless as doom the motor craft drove into
the rowboat and crushed it like an eggshell.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>TO THE RESCUE</h3>
</div>

<p>There was a gasp of horror from the boys as
they saw the three forms struggling in the water
amid the débris of the shattered rowboat.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll be drowned!&#8221; shouted Bob, in an
agony of apprehension.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they can only keep afloat until the motor
boat picks them up,&#8221; ejaculated Joe.</p>
<p>But to the consternation of the boys they saw
that the motor boat occupants had no intention
of going to the rescue. It was not that the men
on the boat were not aware of the damage they
had done. The boys could see the figures of two
men looking backward from the stern towards
the people struggling in the waves. But there
was no halting of the speed of the craft and it
kept on like an arrow, as though it were a criminal
bent only on getting away from the scene
of his crime.</p>
<p>A cry broke from the boys when this conviction
was forced upon them. They clenched their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
fists and shook them toward the retreating craft,
while fierce exclamations broke from their lips.</p>
<p>But there was no time for indulging in vain
objurgations. Bob as usual took the lead.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come along, fellows!&#8221; he shouted, as he set
off like a deer towards a rowboat that was pulled
up on the beach. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to save those people,
and every second counts. Hustle&#8217;s the
word!&#8221;</p>
<p>His companions were close on his heels, and
without loss of time they had reached the boat.
In it were two pairs of oars. They pushed the
boat down the shelving beach into the surf and
jumped aboard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Each one take an oar,&#8221; commanded Bob.
&#8220;Now pull, fellows, with all your strength.
Don&#8217;t mind about the steering. I&#8217;ll tend to that.
Pull! Pull!&#8221;</p>
<p>They did not need any urging, and the boat,
yielding to the impetus of four pairs of arms,
made rapid headway and had soon got beyond
the breakers. But the tide was setting toward
the shore and the waves were running high, while
the wind was strong and against them. Filled
with anxiety as they were, it seemed to them that
the boat was only creeping, though they were
putting their arms and their backs into the work
and pulling with every ounce of strength that
they possessed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span></p>
<p>Bob used his oar both for pulling and steering,
and ever and again cast a glance behind him
to make sure of his course. He could see that
the two men had caught hold of a fragment of
the boat and were trying to keep afloat. The
girl seemed to have fainted and was supported
by the arm of one of the men. As the waves
rolled toward them, they tried to rise with them,
but often they were entirely submerged, and
there was danger that at any moment their hold
might be torn from the slight fragment that alone
kept them afloat.</p>
<p>The need for haste was urgent, and Bob urged
his comrades on with frantic adjurations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pull harder,&#8221; he cried, himself setting the example.
&#8220;Harder yet. Put all you&#8217;ve got into
each stroke. Harder! Harder!&#8221;</p>
<p>It seemed as though their hearts were being
pulled out of their bodies, but they summoned up
all their strength for a final spurt that carried
them into the floating débris of the boat.</p>
<p>&#8220;Easy now,&#8221; cried Bob, as he shipped his oar.
&#8220;You, Herb and Jimmy, just row enough to keep
her head on. Joe, give me a hand.&#8221;</p>
<p>He reached out and caught the arm of the lad
who was supporting the girl. While Bob held
him fast, Joe reached over, took his helpless burden
from his arms, and lifted her into the boat.
That done, they reached over and helped the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
nearly exhausted youths into the boat with what
aid they themselves were able to render. They
were too used up to talk, but their eyes showed
their gratitude.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s that!&#8221; exclaimed Bob, heaving a
sigh of heartfelt relief, as he again took up his
oar. &#8220;Now, fellows, it&#8217;s us for the shore as soon
as we can get there. These people are all in and
need first aid, especially the girl. Let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</p>
<p>With tired arms and bodies but vastly lighter
hearts, they bent to the oars.</p>
<p>And while they are speeding over the waves
with their burden, it may be well, for the benefit
of those who have not read the previous volumes
of this series, to tell who the radio boys were
and what had been their adventures up to the
time this story opens.</p>
<p>Bob Layton was the son of a prosperous chemist
living in the town of Clintonia, a thriving
community of about ten thousand population, situated
on the Shagary River in an Eastern state,
about seventy-five miles from New York. Bob
had been born and brought up there, and was a
general favorite with the people of the town, especially
the boys of his own age, because of his
sunny nature and frank, straightforward character.
He was a natural leader in all wholesome
sports and a crack player on the school baseball
and football teams.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span></p>
<p>His special chum was Joe Atwood, a boy of
about his own age and the son of a leading doctor
of the town. While both were tall, Joe was
of a fair complexion while Bob was dark, and
the dissimilarity extended to other things than
mere appearance. Joe was impulsive and quick-tempered,
and apt to act on the spur of the moment,
while Bob, although never shirking trouble
or a fight if it came his way, was more self-controlled.
But their points of likeness were
more numerous than their points of difference,
and they were the warmest of friends. Where
one was to be found the other was usually not
far off.</p>
<p>Closely associated with them were Herb Fennington
and Jimmy Plummer, slightly younger
but nearly enough of an age to be good comrades.
Jimmy was round and fat and fond of good living,
a trait which had earned him the nickname
of &#8220;Doughnuts.&#8221; Herb was rather easy-going
and fond of telling jokes, of which he always
had a stock in store.</p>
<p>In one way or another the four friends frequently
came into conflict with Buck Looker, the
bully of the town, and his two boon companions,
Carl Lutz and Terry Mooney, who were of the
same stripe, though they deferred to Buck as
their leader.</p>
<p>Ever since the wonderful new science of radio
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
had come into such worldwide prominence, Bob
and his friends had been intensely interested in
it. That interest had been fostered by the stimulating
advice and information given them by Dr.
Amory Dale, the pastor of the old First Church
of Clintonia. How they had made their own receiving
sets in competition for the prize offered
by the member of Congress for their district; the
difficulties they surmounted and the triumphs
they achieved; how Buck and his gang sought to
wreck and steal their sets and the thrashing Buck
received in consequence; how by the agency of
the radio they were able to detect a swindler,
one, Dan Cassey, and force him to make restitution
to Nellie Berwick, an orphan girl he had
tried to cheat; all this and many more exciting
adventures are told in the first book of this series,
entitled: &#8220;The Radio Boys&#8217; First Wireless; Or,
Winning the Ferberton Prize.&#8221;</p>
<p>The winning of the prizes, the first by Bob and
the second by Joe, with honorable mention for
Jimmy, was a spur to fresh efforts in mastering
the wonders of radio. This they carried out at
Ocean Point, a seashore resort, at which they
spent their vacation. How they advanced to the
use of the vacuum tube receiving set from their
first crystal set; their experiences in the wireless
room of a seashore station; their narrow escape
from death on the night of a roaring gale; how,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
under the stress of need, they were able to send
a message to the ship on which relatives and
friends were voyaging and bring other ships to
their aid; how they tracked down and captured
the rascal Cassey after he had assaulted and
robbed their friend Brandon Harvey, the wireless
operator; these things are narrated in the
second volume of this series entitled: &#8220;The Radio
Boys at Ocean Point; Or, The Message That
Saved the Ship.&#8221;</p>
<p>With the radio boys pulling hard at the oars,
it was only a matter of a few minutes before
they had made their way through the breakers
and reached the shore. There they jumped out
and shoved the rowboat up on the beach.</p>
<p>The youths whom they had rescued and who
seemed only little older than themselves had by
this time partially recovered from their exhaustion
and were able to get out themselves, although
they were very shaky on their legs. The girl
had regained consciousness, but was not able to
walk, and the boys debated just what they should
do.</p>
<p>Quite a crowd that had watched the rescue
from the beach were on hand to greet and congratulate
them and offers of help were plentiful.
But Dr. Atwood, Joe&#8217;s father, who had taken a
day off from his extensive practice to spend it
with his family at the Point, solved the problem.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Bring the girl up to my cottage,&#8221; he directed.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll give her the necessary treatment and then
Mrs. Atwood can take charge of her until she&#8217;s
sufficiently recovered to be taken home. I&#8217;ll give
you boys something too that will counteract the
effects of the shock and strain you&#8217;ve been under,
and you&#8217;ll be all right in a little while.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys picked up the girl and carried her
to the Atwood cottage that was only a little distance
away. Rose Atwood together with Agnes
and Amy Fennington, who had come over and
were all interest and attention, recognized her as
Mary Rockwell, a girl whom they had met at the
dance which the radio boys had given, getting
the music over the radio set from a broadcasting
station. Together with Mrs. Atwood, they gave
her all possible care after the doctor had given
her a sedative, and word was sent over to her
people assuring them of her safety.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile the rescued lads, after they
had been looked over by the doctor and given a
slight stimulant, had been borne off bodily by
Bob and the other radio boys to the cottage of
Bob&#8217;s parents, where they sat on the veranda
while supper was being prepared, for Bob had
given them a cordial invitation to take supper and
spend the evening with them.</p>
<p>As they were about the size of Bob and Joe,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
the latter had furnished them with extra suits
of their own clothes while their drenched garments
were taken in charge by Mrs. Layton to
be dried and pressed.</p>
<p>And now for the first time the new acquaintances
were able to take a good look at each other.
What they saw pleased them mutually.</p>
<p>One of the boys was slender and agile, with
frank, honest eyes and a friendly smile that was
almost constantly in evidence. His hair was
brown and wavy and his complexion naturally
fair, though it was at the moment tanned by the
sun and sea air. There was not an ounce of
superfluous flesh on his body, and he gave the
impression of being a trained athlete.</p>
<p>The other had a humorous face that betrayed
Irish ancestry, which was emphasized by the
merest touch of a brogue when he talked. His
hair was red and his face freckled, and there was
something about him that was extremely likable
and made the boys warm to him at once.</p>
<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t had a chance to learn each other&#8217;s
names yet,&#8221; said Bob, with a smile, as the party
settled comfortably into the veranda seats.
&#8220;And that&#8217;s not surprising either,&#8221; he added, &#8220;for
we&#8217;ve been pretty busy since the first moment we
met. This is the first chance we&#8217;ve had to draw
our breaths. My name is Bob Layton, and these
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
pals of mine are Joe Atwood, Herb Fennington
and Jimmy Plummer, the latter the greatest
doughnut eater in captivity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And our handles are Larry Bartlett and Tim
Barcommon,&#8221; said the taller of the two newcomers,
as they laughingly acknowledged the introductions.
&#8220;And before we do anything else
we want to tell you fellows how grateful we are
for the way you came to our help. It would
have been all up for us if you hadn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; chimed in Tim, &#8220;we&#8217;ll never forget it
as long as we live. It was a mighty plucky thing
for you fellows to pull out in the sea that was
running. The sight of you coming was the only
thing that helped me to hold on. I was just
about all in when you reached us. You certainly
sent that old boat spinning along.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that was nothing,&#8221; disclaimed Bob. &#8220;We
just happened to be on the spot. Any one else
would have done the same thing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you notice nobody else did do it,&#8221; replied
Larry. &#8220;There were lots of other people on the
beach that saw the accident, but you were the
only ones that did the hustling. It was a case
of quick thinking as well as plucky acting, and
we owe our lives to you. I only hope that some
time we&#8217;ll be able to do something that will show
you how we appreciate it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What gets me,&#8221; put in Joe, &#8220;was the heartless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
way those fellows in the motor boat acted.
They were simply brutes. They ought to have
their necks wrung.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Herb. &#8220;There was no excuse for
their running you down in the first place. But
after they&#8217;d done it, the least they could have
done was to turn their boat around and pick you
up. We took it for granted that that was what
they would do, and we couldn&#8217;t believe our eyes
when we saw them keep on. Those fellows are
nothing less than murderers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;re about right,&#8221; replied Larry.
&#8220;We counted, too, on their picking us up, and
our only thought was to hold on to any floating
thing we could grab until they could get to us.
And when we saw that they weren&#8217;t going to, we
just about gave up hope. Both Tim and I are
pretty good swimmers, and if we&#8217;d been alone
might have reached the shore. But there was
the girl, and with the water as rough as it was
we had a pretty slim chance of bringing her in,
so it was a case of living or dying together. And
it would have been dying sure enough, if you
hadn&#8217;t happened to be on the beach this afternoon.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would have been especially hard,&#8221; he continued,
&#8220;if the girl had been drowned when she
was out on our invitation and under our protection.
As for ourselves, it would not have mattered
so much. She is an awfully nice girl, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
her family and mine have been acquainted for
years. My mother and hers used to go to school
together. I hadn&#8217;t any idea she was down here
when I decided to spend a couple of weeks at
Ocean Point, but you can imagine how surprised
and delighted I was to find that she and her folks
were stopping at the same hotel I had picked out.
She was a little afraid of the water, but yielded
when we urged her to come out for a row, and
we were all having a dandy time until that motor
boat come along and spoiled everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And think of what the world would have lost
if we&#8217;d been among the missing,&#8221; said Tim, with
a grin. &#8220;No more exhibitions of the Canary
Bird Snake, otherwise known as Larry Bartlett.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or of the famous buck wing and clog dancer,
otherwise known as Tim Barcommon,&#8221; laughed
Larry.</p>
<p>The radio boys looked at each other in some
perplexity.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite get you,&#8221; said Bob.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>AT THE WIRELESS STATION</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Why, it&#8217;s this way,&#8221; explained Larry. &#8220;We
are vaudeville performers. Tim&#8217;s specialty is
dancing, and I can tell you, because he&#8217;s too modest
to say it himself, that he&#8217;s a peach. Whenever
he appears, he just knocks them off their
seats. He&#8217;s a riot.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cut it out,&#8221; protested Tim. &#8220;Leave that to
the press agent.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s straight goods, just the same,&#8221; declared
Larry. &#8220;As for little me, I&#8217;ve got a knack of
twisting myself into knots, and then, too, I do a
little whistling. And because of that they call
me on the posters and in the theater programs the
Canary Bird Snake. Kind of mixed up, isn&#8217;t
it?&#8221;</p>
<p>The radio boys were tremendously interested.
The stage had for them the touch of mystery
and glamour that appeals to youth, and it was
an unusual treat for them to be talking on familiar
terms with characters such as they had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
only seen hitherto in the glare of the footlights.</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be great,&#8221; said Bob, &#8220;to go all over
the country as you do and see all there is to be
seen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, like everything else, theatrical life has its
ups and downs,&#8221; replied Larry. &#8220;It&#8217;s all right
when they hand you applause, but not such fun
when they throw eggs, especially if the eggs are
old. We&#8217;ve never had that experience yet though,
and here&#8217;s hoping that we never shall. There&#8217;s
lots of hard work connected with it, and Tim
and I have to work a good many hours each
day to keep ourselves in trim. Then, too, when
you&#8217;re playing one night stands and have to get
up before daylight to catch a train, which in rube
towns often turns out to be just a caboose attached
to a freight, it isn&#8217;t any fun. And it&#8217;s
less fun when you happen to get snowed in for
a day or two, as has happened to us several times.
But you get paid for all that when your turn goes
big and the audience is friendly and gives you
a good hand. Oh, it isn&#8217;t all peaches and cream,
but take it altogether we have a pretty good
time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is, when we&#8217;re working,&#8221; put in Tim.
&#8220;It isn&#8217;t much fun though when the ghost doesn&#8217;t
walk every Saturday night.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys looked a little puzzled and Larry undertook
to enlighten them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Tim means when the pay check doesn&#8217;t happen
to come along,&#8221; he said. &#8220;In other words,
when we&#8217;re out of a job. You see we&#8217;re both
pretty young in the profession and we aren&#8217;t as
well known as we hope to be later on. We have
to take what we can get on the small-time circuits,
and we know that if we make good there
we&#8217;ll get on the big-time circuit sooner or later.
Just now things are slack in the theatrical line
as they always are in summer. We&#8217;ve got our
lines out for a job in the fall, but nothing definite
has come of it yet. So we thought we&#8217;d come
down to the seashore for a few weeks and get
a little of the sea air into our lungs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we didn&#8217;t figure on getting as much sea
water into our stomachs as we did this afternoon,&#8221;
laughed Tim. &#8220;I can taste it yet. I
don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll want any salt on my victuals for
a month to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just then Mrs. Layton appeared and announced
that supper was ready, and they all obeyed the
call with alacrity, Bob&#8217;s chums being included in
the invitation.</p>
<p>The meal was excellent, as Mrs. Layton&#8217;s always
were, and there was a great deal of jollity
as it progressed. Larry was very droll and kept
the boys in roars of laughter as he told of some
of the funny incidents in his experience, and Tim
was not far behind him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span></p>
<p>After the meal was over, nothing would do
but that Larry and Tim should go through some
of their performances for the entertainment of
the company. This they did, and though they
were handicapped by the absence of the usual
stage properties, Larry not having his stage suit
with him and Tim being without his clog dancing
pumps, the spectators were delighted. Larry
tied himself into a mystifying tangle of knots,
and his whistling was so sweet and melodious
that it roused his audience to the heights of enthusiasm.
And Tim&#8217;s graceful dancing was a
revelation of the possibilities of the Terpsichorean
art.</p>
<p>Then the radio boys took their turn and gave
their visitors a radio concert that was wonderful
in its variety and beauty. The night happened
to be unusually free of the annoying static that
is the bugbear of the wireless, and every note of
the music was as clear and sweet as though the
performers were only a few yards away. Tim
and Larry listened as though they were entranced,
and when the concert was finished they were as
enthusiastic &#8220;fans&#8221; as the radio boys themselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s simply wonderful!&#8221; exclaimed Larry.
&#8220;It&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve ever had the chance to
&#8217;listen in,&#8217; but you can bet it won&#8217;t be the last.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what,&#8221; proposed Bob. &#8220;We&#8217;re
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
going over to the wireless sending station to-morrow
morning to see the operator there, Mr.
Harvey. He&#8217;s the finest kind of a fellow, and
he&#8217;ll be glad to see you. Suppose you and Tim
come along with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Surest thing you know!&#8221; ejaculated Larry,
and Tim acquiesced with equal enthusiasm.</p>
<p>They parted for the night with a feeling on
both sides of warm liking and esteem and a looking
forward to a most enjoyable time on the following
day.</p>
<p>The next morning the radio boys set out shortly
after breakfast, met Larry and Tim at a point
previously agreed upon, and together took their
way toward the wireless station.</p>
<p>Mr. Harvey was alone when they entered, and
jumped to his feet with hands extended in greeting
and a face beaming with welcome.</p>
<p>&#8220;What good wind blew you over here?&#8221; he exclaimed,
as he shook their hands heartily.</p>
<p>&#8220;We came because we wanted to see you, and
also because we wanted to show our friends here
something of the way the wireless works,&#8221; said
Bob.</p>
<p>He introduced Larry and Tim and Mr. Harvey
welcomed them so warmly that they felt at once
at home.</p>
<p>&#8220;So these are the young men you boys pulled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
out of the water yesterday,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s
mighty lucky for them that you happened to be
around.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll say it was,&#8221; agreed Larry, and Tim
nodded vigorously.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you happen to hear of it?&#8221; asked
Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hear of it?&#8221; Brandon Harvey repeated. &#8220;All
the beach is ringing with it. All the hotels are
buzzing with it. If you&#8217;ll look at the morning
papers from the city, you&#8217;ll find they all have a
full account of it with comments on the pluck
and presence of mind of the fellows who did it.
You can&#8217;t get away with that stuff without having
it known, no matter how modest you are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Making lots of fuss about a trifle,&#8221; muttered
Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;Trifle,&#8221; laughed Harvey. &#8220;Just the same
kind of a trifle as that you pulled off the night
you saved the ship and captured the man who
had knocked me out. Have they told you about
that?&#8221; he asked, turning to Larry and Tim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a word,&#8221; replied Larry.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never breathed it,&#8221; declared Tim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just like them,&#8221; asserted Brandon Harvey,
and then went on to tell them of that dreadful
night when the storm was raging; how they had
found him knocked senseless on the floor and
the safe looted; how they had sent the signals
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
that had saved the ship from destruction; how
they had pursued the robber and captured him
after a hand to hand tussle and recovered the
loot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, now about the wireless,&#8221; interposed
Bob, anxious to change the subject. &#8220;These
friends of ours are a new addition to the army
of fans and we want to put them next to some
of the wonders of radio.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a great army all right,&#8221; laughed Harvey,
&#8220;and we&#8217;re always glad to welcome new recruits.
They&#8217;re coming into the ranks by thousands every
day. Nobody can keep count of them, but they
must run into the millions.</p>
<p>&#8220;And they&#8217;re great in quality as well as quantity,&#8221;
he continued, warming to his favorite subject.
&#8220;The President of the United States has
a radio receiving set on his desk. There&#8217;s one
in the office of every one of the ten Cabinet members.
The Secretary of the Navy is sending out
wireless messages every day to vessels scattered
in all parts of the globe. The head of the army
is keeping in touch by radio with every fort and
garrison and corps area in the United States.
On last Arbor Day the Secretary of Agriculture
talked over the radio to more people than ever
heard an address in the history of the world.
But there,&#8221; he said, breaking off with a laugh,
&#8220;if I once get going on this line I&#8217;ll never know
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
when to stop. So I&#8217;ll say it all in one sentence&mdash;the
radio is the most wonderful invention ever
conceived by the mind of man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t need to prove it to us,&#8221; laughed
Bob. &#8220;It&#8217;s simply a miracle, and we become
more convinced of that every day. I&#8217;m mighty
glad I was born in this age of the world.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys crowded around Mr. Harvey as he
explained to Larry and Tim in as simple a way
as possible the radio apparatus of the station.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I press this key,&#8221; he said, &#8220;an electrical
spark is sent up into the antenna, the big wire
that you see suspended from the mast over the
station, and is flung out into space.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Travels pretty fast, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221; asked Larry,
to whom all this was new.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather,&#8221; laughed Mr. Harvey. &#8220;It can go
seven and a half times around the world while
you are striking a match.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221; exclaimed Larry incredulously.
&#8220;Why, the circle of the earth is about twenty-five
thousand miles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Exactly,&#8221; smiled Harvey. &#8220;And that spark
travels at the rate of one hundred and eighty-six
thousand miles a second.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re sure you don&#8217;t mean feet instead of
miles?&#8221; suggested Tim dubiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s miles all right,&#8221; laughed Harvey. &#8220;Electricity
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
travels at the same rate as the light that
comes to us from the sun and stars.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What becomes of this electrical impulse after
it gets started on that quick trip?&#8221; asked Larry.
&#8220;How does the fellow on the other end get what
you&#8217;re trying to tell him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That fellow or that station has another antenna
waiting to receive my message,&#8221; replied
Harvey. &#8220;The signal keeps on going through
the ether until it strikes that other antenna.
Then it climbs along it until it reaches the receiving
set and registers the same kind of dot or
dash as the one I made at this end. It&#8217;s like the
pitcher and catcher of a baseball battery. One
pitches the ball and the other receives the same
ball. At one instant it&#8217;s in the pitcher&#8217;s hand
and the next it has traveled the space between
the two and is resting in the catcher&#8217;s hand.
Sounds simple, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sounds simple when you put it that way,&#8221;
laughed Larry. &#8220;But I have a hunch that it
isn&#8217;t as simple as it sounds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, to tell the truth, it isn&#8217;t quite as simple
as that,&#8221; confessed Harvey. &#8220;There&#8217;s a whole
lot to learn about receiving and transmitting and
detectors and generators and condensers and vacuum
tubes and all that. But my point is that
there&#8217;s nothing of the really essential things that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
are concerned in getting entertainment and instruction
from radio that can&#8217;t be learned with
a little application by any one of ordinary intelligence.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if I&#8217;m in that class,&#8221; said Larry
quizzically, and there was a general laugh.</p>
<p>Another half hour was spent with great profit
and interest in the sending station and then the
boys arose to go.</p>
<p>&#8220;How are you getting along with that regenerative
set?&#8221; asked Mr. Harvey of Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty well, thank you,&#8221; answered Bob.
&#8220;It&#8217;s the proper adjusting of the tickler that&#8217;s
giving me the most trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Be careful not to increase it too far,&#8221; warned
Harvey. &#8220;If you do, the vacuum tube oscillates
and becomes a small generator of high frequency
current and in that way will interfere with other
near-by stations. Then, too, the speeches and
music will be mushy instead of being clear.
Drop in again when you have time and we&#8217;ll talk
the matter over a little further.&#8221;</p>
<p>The visitors bade their host farewell and
trooped out into the bright sunshine. Larry and
Tim were enthusiastic over the new world into
which they had been introduced.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most wonderful thing in the world,&#8221; was
their verdict.</p>
<p>They spent the rest of the morning on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
beach, and before they parted, Larry had secured
a promise from the radio boys to come over to
a dance that was to be held the next night at
the hotel where he and Tim were stopping.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jolliest kind of fellows, aren&#8217;t they?&#8221; said Joe.</p>
<p>&#8220;They sure are,&#8221; agreed Herb. &#8220;I should
think that free and easy life of theirs would be
just one round of enjoyment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t exactly say that,&#8221; remarked Bob.
&#8220;Two or three times I have noticed a look of
worry in Larry&#8217;s eyes as though something were
weighing on his mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>This arrow, shot at a venture, was indeed correct,
for Larry was far from being as care free
as the boys imagined. The fact that he was out
of work at present worried him, naturally. But
this would have but little weight with him had it
not been for his sick mother at home. That
mother had worked for years in his behalf, following
the death of his father, whose affairs were
so involved at his death that there was little
money left to support his wife and child. The
mother had kept up a brave heart, however, and
done the best she could for herself and her idolized
son. The strain of being both bread-winner
and mother had told, however, and now she was
in ill health. Larry, since he had entered upon
a profession, had sent to her all that he possibly
could in order to maintain her in comfort, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
just now the source of supply had stopped and
there was no knowing at what time it would be
resumed. He knew that his mother had very
little money on hand at the time, and her condition
of health made Larry her only resource.</p>
<p>The radio boys kept their engagement, and
the dance was a jolly affair at which they enjoyed
themselves thoroughly. The only drawback
to a perfect evening was the fact that Buck
Looker and Carl Lutz were there also, but this
did not bother them much in the early part of
the evening.</p>
<p>The last dance had just been concluded and the
ardent dancers were clamoring for one more encore,
when a disturbance rose at one end of the
room that attracted general attention. The radio
boys hurried to the spot in question to find Buck
and Lutz talking excitedly while Larry and Tim
were standing near them with flushed and indignant
faces. The manager of the hotel and a
house detective were also in the group.</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you that those are the fellows who did
it,&#8221; Buck was vociferating, while he pointed to
Larry and Tim. &#8220;They were the ones closest
to me when I missed my watch and stickpin, and
I had just looked at my watch the minute before.
If you search them you&#8217;ll find the goods on them.
My friend here lost his at the same time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s false!&#8221; cried Larry.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If there weren&#8217;t ladies here, I&#8217;d cram the
story down your throat!&#8221; exclaimed Tim, his eyes
blazing.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a serious charge you&#8217;re making, young
man,&#8221; said the manager to Buck.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve got them,&#8221; said Buck sullenly.
&#8220;Search them and you&#8217;ll find I&#8217;m right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;See here,&#8221; cried Larry. &#8220;If this fellow were
the only one concerned I wouldn&#8217;t condescend to
satisfy him. But I have some friends here,&#8221; indicating
the radio boys, &#8220;and for their sakes I&#8217;m
going to establish my innocence beyond any
doubt. Come right in to one of the private
rooms here and search me thoroughly. As for
this fellow,&#8221; glaring at Buck, &#8220;I&#8217;ll settle with him
at another time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The party adjourned to a room, and a thorough
search resulted in showing that none of the
missing articles was on Larry or Tim.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I&#8217;ll settle with you,&#8221; cried Larry, making
a rush at Buck. But he was restrained by
the house detective who held him while Buck and
his crony slunk away.</p>
<p>The radio boys gathered around their new
friends and condoled with them over the unfounded
accusation.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll pay me for that yet,&#8221; declared Larry,
who had been wrought up to a high pitch of excitement.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s hoping you&#8217;ll get a hack at him,&#8221; said
Joe. &#8220;Did you notice that there wasn&#8217;t a word
of apology for having made a false charge against
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever know him to do a decent thing?&#8221;
asked Bob scornfully. &#8220;That&#8217;s Buck Looker to
a dot.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next morning Bob was over at Joe&#8217;s bungalow
when Mr. and Mrs. Rockwell called with
Mary to thank the Atwoods for the care they had
given Mary when she was brought from the water,
and also to express their gratitude to the boys,
whose quickness and resource had saved her life.</p>
<p>Mary, a pretty girl, had entirely recovered, and
was profuse in her thanks to Bob and Joe, which
were echoed by her parents, who laid so much
stress upon their bravery that the boys blushed to
the ears.</p>
<p>&#8220;You are making altogether too much of it,&#8221;
Bob protested, and Joe agreed.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is impossible to do that,&#8221; said Mr. Rockwell,
and Mrs. Rockwell nodded her head
vigorously.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only thing I am sorry about,&#8221; said Bob,
&#8220;is that we have not been able to catch the fellows
in the motor boat who ran the rowboat
down. They ought to be sent to jail on the double
quick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It turns out,&#8221; said Mr. Rockwell, &#8220;that they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
were not only heartless brutes, but thieves as well.
We found out yesterday that the boat had been
stolen from Mr. Wentworth, who is one of the
guests at the hotel where we are stopping. They
left an old rowboat in its place. Mr. Wentworth
has put the police on the track of the thieves, but
as yet nothing has been heard of them. I am
afraid they have made good their escape.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I only hope,&#8221; declared Bob, &#8220;that I may live
long enough to get my hands on the throat of one
or both of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like that privilege,&#8221; returned Mr. Rockwell
warmly, &#8220;but I am afraid the chances are
slim. They may be hundreds of miles away by
this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Joe, &#8220;the arm of the law is long
and it may reach them yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s hoping,&#8221; said Bob.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>RADIO PLANS</h3>
</div>

<p>Shortly after the unfortunate affair at the
dance Larry and Tim came to the Layton bungalow,
overjoyed at a letter they had just received.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bob, our streak of bad luck must be broken
at last,&#8221; exulted Larry. &#8220;It was beginning to
look like the bread line for ours, but now maybe
we&#8217;ll be able to eat heartily again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t look very hungry just at present,&#8221;
grinned Bob. &#8220;But what does it say in that letter
that you&#8217;re waving around, anyway?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got an engagement, at last,&#8221; put in
Tim. &#8220;And, oh, boy! make out it doesn&#8217;t seem
like money from home!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s certainly fine,&#8221; said Bob, heartily.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s with Chasson&#8217;s vaudeville show,&#8221; explained
Larry. &#8220;It&#8217;s a traveling show, and we
probably won&#8217;t show more than one or two nights
in a town. Of course, it isn&#8217;t as swell an outfit
as we would like to connect up with, but it will
keep the wolf from the door for a little while.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It will tide us over until we can hook up with
something classier, anyway,&#8221; said Tim. &#8220;The
chances are we&#8217;ll play in all the towns around this
part of the country, and if we land in the one
you fellows live in, we&#8217;ll expect you to applaud
our act harder than any of the others, no matter
how bad we are.&#8221; And he grinned.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you come to Clintonia, you can bet we&#8217;ll
give you the glad hand, all right,&#8221; promised Bob.
&#8220;I suppose we all get free passes, don&#8217;t we?&#8221; with
a twinkle in his eye.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d get all you want if Tim and I had the
say-so,&#8221; said Larry, &#8220;but the manager probably
won&#8217;t be able to see it that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some day we&#8217;ll have a show of our own,
maybe,&#8221; said Tim. &#8220;Then we&#8217;ll give you all
passes, you can bet your boots on that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t try to hold your breath until then,
though,&#8221; said Larry. &#8220;The way things are
breaking for us lately, we&#8217;ll be more likely to be
inviting our friends to come and visit us in the
poorhouse.&#8221;</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto; '><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;Over the hills to the poorhouse,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>It&#8217;s not so far away,</p>

</td></tr></table>

<p>chanted Tim, immediately afterward breaking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
into a lively jig to express his indifference to that
mournful possibility.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if you ever do land in that cheerful
place, you&#8217;ll be very popular,&#8221; laughed Bob.
&#8220;But now that you&#8217;ve both got an engagement,
you won&#8217;t have to worry about that for some
time to come. I know the other fellows will be
glad to hear about it, too. They went down to
town this morning, but they ought to be back
pretty soon now. Stick around till they come,
and we&#8217;ll tell them the glad news.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Surest thing you know,&#8221; acquiesced Larry.
&#8220;We don&#8217;t have to report to Chasson until day
after to-morrow, anyway. How&#8217;s the wireless
coming along these days?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine and dandy,&#8221; responded Bob. &#8220;After we
get back to Clintonia we intend to build some big
sets so that we can receive signals from all over
the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But where do you get all the money to buy
that stuff?&#8221; asked Larry. &#8220;Some of it must be
pretty expensive, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not as expensive as you might think, although
some of the apparatus, like audion bulbs, certainly
run into money,&#8221; replied Bob. &#8220;But we
can easily sell the apparatus that we already have,
and make enough on that to buy the new things
with. There are plenty of people ready and anxious
to buy our sets, because we can sell them for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
less than the store would charge, and they work
as well or better than some store sets.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s talking of selling our sets?&#8221; broke in
a well-known voice, as Joe, Herb and Jimmy
came, pellmell, into the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was,&#8221; said Bob, in answer to Jimmy&#8217;s question.
&#8220;I was thinking of selling your set to the
junkman, for what it would bring.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; exclaimed Jimmy, indignantly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
bet a junkman wouldn&#8217;t even buy yours. He&#8217;d
expect you to pay him to take it away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, you fellows must have a high opinion
of each other&#8217;s radio outfits,&#8221; broke in Tim,
laughing. &#8220;But if you want to give one away,
here&#8217;s Tiny Tim, ready and waiting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No chance,&#8221; said Jimmy, positively. &#8220;I
worked too many hot nights on mine to give it
away now, and I guess Bob thinks he&#8217;d like to
keep his, too, even though it isn&#8217;t really much
good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was good enough to take the Ferberton
prize, anyway, which is more than some people
can say of theirs,&#8221; Bob replied, grinning. &#8220;How
about it, Doughnuts?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was because the judges didn&#8217;t know any
better,&#8221; said his rotund friend. &#8220;They should
have made me the judge, and then there&#8217;s no
doubt but what my set would have won that hundred
bucks.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We can believe that easily enough,&#8221; laughed
Larry. &#8220;But you radio bugs forget your hobby
for a few minutes and listen to the glad news,&#8221;
and then he told them about the engagement he
and Tim had secured.</p>
<p>All the boys congratulated them on their good
fortune, and after some further conversation the
two actors departed, first promising to drop in
for a visit before going away to start their engagement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I like those two fellows first rate, and would
be mighty glad to see them succeed,&#8221; said Bob,
after they had gone. &#8220;It seems to me they ought
to make a big hit, too. They&#8217;re a regular riot
all the time they&#8217;re with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, they&#8217;re certainly funny,&#8221; agreed Joe.
&#8220;What were you telling them about selling our
sets, just as we came in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I was just saying that we could get money
to buy new apparatus, audion bulbs, and that sort
of expensive stuff, by selling one or two of the
sets we&#8217;ve got now, and whacking up the proceeds,&#8221;
said Bob. &#8220;My dad spoke of that last evening,
and it struck me as a mighty good idea. I
know of several people in Clintonia who would
like nothing better than to have a good set, and
having made them ourselves, we can sell them
cheaper than the stores, and still make money on
them.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Say, that&#8217;s a pretty good stunt,&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;I
was trying to figure out the other day where we
could get the necessary cash. The cheapest audion
bulb you can buy costs about three dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>The other boys, also, were pleased with this
idea, and said so. They agreed to sell two of
their sets as soon as they got back to Clintonia.
This was their last week at Ocean Point, for the
fall term of the high school started the following
Monday, and they were to leave Ocean Point on
Saturday.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be pretty hard to bone down to lessons
again, after a summer like this, but I suppose
there&#8217;s no help for it,&#8221; said Jimmy, mournfully.
&#8220;I feel as though I&#8217;d forgotten all I ever knew.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t much, so you don&#8217;t need to worry
about it,&#8221; said Joe, with pleasing frankness.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you think you&#8217;re a regular Solomon,
don&#8217;t you?&#8221; retorted Jimmy. &#8220;Nobody else does,
though, I can tell you that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quit your scrapping,&#8221; admonished Herb.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t either of you know a single good
joke, while I&#8217;m just full of wit and humor. Why,
here&#8217;s a joke I thought up just the other day, and
I don&#8217;t mind admitting that it&#8217;s a pippin, not to
say peacherino. I thought it up while I was
watching some fellows play tennis, and I just
know you&#8217;re all crazy to hear it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d have to be crazy to want to hear it,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
said Bob. &#8220;But probably you&#8217;ll feel better after
you get it out of your system, so fire ahead, and
we&#8217;ll do our best to stand the strain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This won&#8217;t be any strain; it will be a pleasure,&#8221;
said Herb. &#8220;Now, this joke is in the form
of a humorous question and an even more humorous
answer. Oh, it&#8217;s a wonder, I&#8217;ll say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll say something, too, if you don&#8217;t hurry
up and get the agony over with,&#8221; threatened Joe.
&#8220;Make it snappy, before we weaken under the
strain and throw you out the window.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; said Herb: &#8220;Why does the tennis
ball? And the answer is: Because the catgut
on the racquet.&#8221; And he broke into a peal of
laughter, in which, however, his friends refused
to join.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; asked Herb, cutting
short his laughter as he saw that the others
only shook their heads despondently. &#8220;Why in
the name of all that&#8217;s good don&#8217;t you laugh?
Wasn&#8217;t that a peach of a joke?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Herb, the only reason we don&#8217;t kill you right
away is because you will be punished more by being
allowed to live and suffer,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;That
was a fierce joke.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, get out!&#8221; exclaimed Herb, in an injured
tone. &#8220;You fellows don&#8217;t know a clever joke
when you hear it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Likely enough we don&#8217;t,&#8221; admitted Joe. &#8220;We
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
don&#8217;t get much chance to hear clever jokes while
you&#8217;re around.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, if you don&#8217;t like my jokes, why
don&#8217;t you think up some of your own?&#8221; asked
Herb, in an aggrieved tone. &#8220;There&#8217;s no law
against it, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There ought to be, though,&#8221; put in Jimmy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, what do you know about it?&#8221; asked Herb,
incensed at the laughter that followed this thrust.
&#8220;All you can think of, Doughnuts, is what you&#8217;re
going to get to eat when the next meal time comes
around.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I enjoy thinking of that so much, that
I&#8217;d be foolish to think of anything else,&#8221; said
Jimmy, serenely.</p>
<p>&#8220;You win, Jimmy,&#8221; said Bob, as he and Joe
shouted with laughter at Herb&#8217;s discomfiture.
The latter was inclined to be sulky at first, but he
soon forgot his ill humor, and was as gay as the
others as they discussed their plans for the fall
and winter months.</p>
<p>Contrary to the predictions of some of their
neighbors in Clintonia, their enthusiasm for radio
work had increased rather than diminished,
and they were anxious to become the possessors
of sets capable of hearing any station in the
United States, and perhaps even the large foreign
stations. Of course, this meant that their apparatus
would have to be much more intricate and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
expensive than any they had constructed hitherto,
but the realization of this did not deter them.
On the contrary, the thought that the task would
be one to tax their skill and knowledge to the utmost
only served to make them more eager to
begin. They examined numberless catalogues
and circulars in an effort to determine where and
at what cost they could obtain their necessary
supplies, jotting down notes as they went along.
By supper time they had acquired a pretty good
idea of what their new equipment would cost, and
were pleased to find that it came within the
amount that they thought they could get by selling
two of their present complete sets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; said Bob, in conclusion, as they
heard the supper bell ring, &#8220;the first thing we do
when we get back home will be to sell the two
sets, and then we&#8217;ll get busy on making the new
ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>With this the others agreed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>BACK FROM THE BEACH</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye, old bungalows, we hate to leave
you. Here&#8217;s hoping we see you again next
summer.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Herb speaking, as the radio boys and
their families left the group of cottages where
all had spent such an eventful and pleasant summer.
Brilliant sunlight beat down on the yellow
sand, but its heat was very different from the
torrid rays that had kept them running to the
ocean to cool off all that summer. There was a
clear and sparkling appearance to the air and sky,
and the wind that came sweeping over the level
sands had a nip in it that made even Jimmy walk
fast to keep warm.</p>
<p>They were to return home by train instead of
automobile, and all the ladies had gone to the station
in the big motor omnibus, but the boys had
preferred to walk, as the distance was not great
and there was still plenty of time before the train
was due.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had a wonderful time here, there&#8217;s no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
doubt of that,&#8221; said Bob, commenting on Herb&#8217;s
apostrophe to the bungalows. &#8220;But it will seem
nice to get home again, too. I&#8217;ve almost forgotten
what the old town looks like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will seem good to see the old bunch at High
once more, too,&#8221; added Joe. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet there aren&#8217;t
many of them have had the fun that we&#8217;ve had
ever since we landed at Ocean Point.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not only that, but we&#8217;ve learned a lot, too,&#8221;
said Bob. &#8220;We were running in luck when we
met Mr. Harvey and had the run of that big station.
It was a wonderful opportunity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet it was,&#8221; agreed Herb. &#8220;It&#8217;s a wonderful
place to think up jokes in, too. I don&#8217;t
think I ever thought of so many good ones in a
single summer before.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know you thought of any good ones,&#8221;
said Joe. &#8220;All those that we heard were punk.
Why didn&#8217;t you tell us some of the good ones for
a change?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So I did, you poor boob,&#8221; retorted Herb.
&#8220;My one regret here was that we didn&#8217;t have a
sending set. Then I could have broadcasted some
of those jokes, and everybody could have had the
benefit of them free of charge.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It would have to be free of charge,&#8221; said
Jimmy, cruelly. &#8220;You don&#8217;t suppose anybody
would pay real money to hear that low brand of
humor, do you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Chances are they&#8217;d pay real money <i>not</i> to hear
them,&#8221; put in Joe, before Herb could answer.
&#8220;But I suppose if Herb ever started anything like
that the Government would take away his license
before he could do much harm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said Herb resignedly. &#8220;You
can knock all you want now, but when I get to
be rich and famous, like Mark Twain, for instance,
you&#8217;ll be sorry that you were so dumb that
you couldn&#8217;t appreciate me sooner.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we won&#8217;t have to worry until you are
rich and famous, and that probably won&#8217;t be for a
year or two yet,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;But here we are
at the station. They all look glad to see us. I&#8217;ll
bet they were afraid we wouldn&#8217;t get here in
time.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was indeed the case, as was evidenced by
much gesturing and waving of parasols and handkerchiefs
by the feminine members of the party.
They had heard the whistle of the train in the distance,
and had firmly persuaded themselves that
the boys would be delayed and lose the train. As
it turned out, however, the boys had plenty of
time, and were on the platform and waiting as
the engine puffed into the station.</p>
<p>As the train pulled out, they all gazed back regretfully
at the little village that had become so
familiar to them. Many of the shops were closed
and shuttered for the season, and the main street
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
wore a deserted air. However, as the train
rounded a curve and the village was lost to view,
they regained their usual spirits.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a wonder you boys didn&#8217;t miss the train
altogether,&#8221; said Agnes, Herb&#8217;s sister. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
see why you didn&#8217;t hurry a little. We were on
pins and needles all the time until you showed
up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, what&#8217;s the use of standing on an old station
platform for an hour and spending your time
wondering why the train doesn&#8217;t show up?&#8221; said
Herb. &#8220;We could have left the bungalows ten
minutes later and still caught the train. I don&#8217;t
enjoy riding on a train unless I&#8217;ve had to run to
get it, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If this train had been on time, you would have
had a fast run to get it, I can tell you,&#8221; said Amy,
Agnes&#8217; younger sister. &#8220;It was about fifteen
minutes late, and that&#8217;s the only reason you got
it at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we could run almost as fast as this train
goes, anyway,&#8221; boasted her brother. &#8220;And
speaking of slow trains, that reminds me of a
good story I read the other day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, please tell us about it,&#8221; said Agnes, with
mock enthusiasm. &#8220;You know we always love
to hear your jokes, brother dear.&#8221;</p>
<p>Herb glanced suspiciously at her, but was too
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
glad of an opportunity to tell his story to inquire
into her sincerity.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems there was a man traveling on a southern
railroad&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he began, but Jimmy interrupted
him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which railroad?&#8221; he inquired.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter which railroad,&#8221; said Herb,
glaring at his friend. &#8220;It was a railroad, anyway,
and a slow one, too. Well, this man was in
a hurry, it seems, and kept fidgeting around and
looking at his watch. Finally the train stopped
altogether, and a moment later the conductor came
through the car.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;What&#8217;s the matter, Conductor?&#8217; asked the
traveler.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;There&#8217;s a cow on the track,&#8217; answered the
conductor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, pretty soon the train started on again,
but it hadn&#8217;t gone very far before it stopped
once more. &#8216;Say, Conductor, why in blazes
have we stopped again?&#8217; asked the traveler.
&#8216;Seems to me this is the slowest train I ever rode
on.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It can&#8217;t be helped, sir,&#8217; answered the conductor.
&#8216;We&#8217;ve caught up with that pesky cow
again.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>They all laughed at this anecdote, which pleased
Herb immensely.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I know lots more, any time you want to hear
them,&#8221; he ventured, hopefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;Better not take a chance on spoiling that one,
Herb,&#8221; advised Joe. &#8220;That was unusually good
for you, I must admit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Herb&#8217;s jokes wouldn&#8217;t be so bad if he&#8217;d stick
to regular ones,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;It&#8217;s only when he
starts making them up himself that they get so
terrible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and just think of his poor sisters,&#8221; sighed
Agnes. &#8220;In the summer it isn&#8217;t quite so bad, because
he&#8217;s out of the house most of the time, but
in winter it&#8217;s simply terrible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, this winter I won&#8217;t have much time to
waste on you and Amy, trying to develop a sense
of humor in you,&#8221; said Herb. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to
build a radio set of my own that will be a cuckoo.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hurrah for you!&#8221; exclaimed Bob. &#8220;That&#8217;s a
better way to spend your time, and what a relief
it will be for all of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you think you&#8217;re kidding me, but
you&#8217;re not,&#8221; said Herbert. &#8220;I&#8217;ll make a set this
winter that will make you amateurs turn green
with envy. You see if I don&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be fine if you do,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;There&#8217;s
no reason why you shouldn&#8217;t if you really want
to.&#8221;</p>
<p>The time passed quickly, and before they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
realized it they heard the conductor call the name of
their own town.</p>
<p>&#8220;Goodness gracious!&#8221; exclaimed Agnes, &#8220;are
we really there so soon? And I haven&#8217;t got any
of my things together yet!&#8221;</p>
<p>There was great bustle and confusion for a few
moments, and then the whole party found themselves
on the familiar platform of the Clintonia
station. Several taxicabs were requisitioned, and
they were all whisked away to their respective
homes, after the radio boys had agreed to meet at
Bob&#8217;s house that evening.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>RADIO&#8217;S LONG ARM</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Well, fellows,&#8221; said Bob, when they were together
that evening, according to agreement,
&#8220;this is the last evening we&#8217;ll have without lessons
for some time to come, so we&#8217;d better make
the most of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mention lessons, Bob,&#8221; implored Jimmy.
&#8220;Oh, my, how I hate &#8217;em!&#8221; and he groaned
dismally.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll soon be doing them, old timer, whether
you like them or not,&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;It&#8217;s going to
be a tough term for me, too. I&#8217;ll be taking up
geometry this term, and they say that&#8217;s no cinch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing&#8217;s a cinch for me, worse luck,&#8221; said
Jimmy, dolefully. &#8220;Everything I do seems to be
hard work for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s tough luck, too,&#8221; said Bob, gravely,
&#8220;because you hate work so much, Doughnuts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t anybody in the world hates it
more,&#8221; confessed Jimmy, shamelessly. &#8220;But
that&#8217;s all the good it ever does me. Why wasn&#8217;t
I born rich instead of good looking?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Give it up,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;You&#8217;ll have to ask
me easier ones than that, Jimmy, if you expect to
get an answer. But as far as I can see, people
that are rich don&#8217;t seem to be especially happy,
anyway. Look at old Abubus Boggs. He&#8217;s
probably the richest man in Clintonia, but nobody
ever accused him of being happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say not!&#8221; exclaimed Joe. &#8220;He goes
around looking as though he had just bitten into
an especially sour lemon. Everybody hates him,
and I don&#8217;t suppose that makes any one happy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe that does make old Abubus happy,
there&#8217;s no telling,&#8221; said Jimmy, reflectively.
&#8220;But I know I wouldn&#8217;t change places for all his
money.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There you are!&#8221; exclaimed Bob, triumphantly.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t realize how well off you are, Doughnuts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe not,&#8221; conceded Jimmy. &#8220;School isn&#8217;t
so bad after you once get started, but I hate to
think of settling down to the old grind after that
wonderful summer at Ocean Point.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we&#8217;ll have the radio just the same,&#8221; Joe
pointed out. &#8220;That&#8217;s one of the good things
about it; you can take it with you wherever you
go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I was reading an article in one of the
radio magazines a little while ago about that,&#8221;
said Bob. &#8220;The article was written by a trapper
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
in the northern part of Canada. He told how he
had set up his outfit in the center of a howling
wilderness and had received all the latest news of
the world in his shack, not to mention music of
every kind. He said that the natives and Indians
thought it must be magic, and were looking all
over the shack for the spirit that they supposed
must be talking into the headphones. That trapper
was certainly a radio fan, if there ever was
one, and he wrote a mighty interesting letter, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think it would be interesting,&#8221; said
Herb. &#8220;I&#8217;d like to read it, if you still have it
around.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob rummaged around in a big pile of radio
magazines and finally found what he was looking
for. The boys read every word of the letter, and
were more than ever impressed by the wonderful
possibilities of radiophony.</p>
<p>No longer would it be necessary for an exploring
expedition to be lost sight of for months, or
even years. Wedged in the Arctic ice floes, or
contending with fever and savage animals in the
depths of some tropical jungle, the explorers
could keep in touch with the civilized world as
easily as though bound on a week end fishing trip.
The aeroplane soaring in the clouds far above
the earth, or the submarine under the earth&#8217;s waters,
could be informed and guided by it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
Certainly of all the wonders of modern times, this
was the most marvelous and far-reaching.</p>
<p>Something of all this passed through the boys&#8217;
minds as they sat in ruminative silence, thinking
of the lonely man in the wilderness with his precious
wireless.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose we should feel pretty lucky to be
around just at this stage of the earth&#8217;s history,&#8221;
said Bob, thoughtfully. &#8220;We&#8217;re living in an age
of wonders, and I suppose we&#8217;re so used to them
that most of the time we don&#8217;t realize how wonderful
they really are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true enough, all right,&#8221; agreed Joe.
&#8220;When you step into an automobile these days,
you don&#8217;t stop to think that a few years ago the
fastest way to travel was behind old Dobbin. The
old world is stepping ahead pretty lively these
days, and no mistake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t step too fast to suit me,&#8221; said Herb.
&#8220;Speed is what I like to see, every time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Jimmy, lazily. &#8220;Why
not take things a little easier. People had just
as much fun out of life when they weren&#8217;t in such
a rush about everything. I take things easy and
get fat on it, while Herb is always rushing around,
and it wears him down until he has the same general
appearance as a five and ten cent store clothespin.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t want to look like a three and nine
cent store pin-cushion, anyway,&#8221; said Herb, indignantly.
&#8220;That&#8217;s about your style of beauty,
Doughnuts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I never expect to take any prizes in a
beauty show, so that doesn&#8217;t make me mad,&#8221; said
Jimmy, calmly.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you weren&#8217;t so blamed fat, I&#8217;d have half a
mind to throw you out the window, you old
faker,&#8221; said Herb, threateningly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t do it,&#8221; said Jimmy, briefly. &#8220;In the
first place, I&#8217;m too heavy; and in the second place,
Bob wouldn&#8217;t let you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet Bob would be glad to see you thrown
out. How about it, Bob?&#8221; and Herb appealed to
his friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t want you to throw him out of
either of these windows,&#8221; answered Bob, seriously.
&#8220;There are valuable plants on the lawn
below, and I&#8217;d hate to see them damaged. But
if you want to take him out and drop him from
the hall window, I&#8217;m sure nobody will have any
objections.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I can&#8217;t be bothered carrying him that far,&#8221;
said Herb. &#8220;Guess I might as well let him live
a while longer, after all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s very nice of you,&#8221; said Jimmy, sarcastically.
&#8220;But you know you couldn&#8217;t do it, anyway.
All I&#8217;d have to do would be to fall on you,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
Herb, and it would be curtains for little Herbert.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think they&#8217;re both afraid of each other, Joe,&#8221;
said Bob, turning to his friend. &#8220;What&#8217;s your
opinion?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Looks that way to me, too. They remind me
of a couple of cats that stand and yell at each
other for an hour, and then walk off without mixing
it after all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;re not going to go to mauling each
other just to amuse you two Indians, that&#8217;s certain,&#8221;
said Herb. &#8220;Let&#8217;s shake hands and show
the world we&#8217;re friends, Jimmy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Righto!&#8221; agreed his good-natured friend, and
they laughingly shook hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d better save our scrapping for Buck
Looker and his friends,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;I suppose
they&#8217;ll be up to some kind of mischief as soon
as we get back to school again. They seem never
to learn by experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re too foolish and conceited to learn
much,&#8221; observed Joe. &#8220;They probably think
they know all there is to know already.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In spite of that, we may be able to teach them
a trick or two,&#8221; said Herb. &#8220;But whether you
fellows know it or not, it&#8217;s getting pretty late, so
I think I&#8217;ll go and hit the hay. Who&#8217;s coming
my way?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose we might as well all beat it,&#8221; returned
Joe, rising. &#8220;If we don&#8217;t see each other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
to-morrow, I suppose we&#8217;ll all meet at the dear
old high school on Monday morning. Three silent
cheers, fellows.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Consider them given,&#8221; laughed Bob. &#8220;But
we&#8217;ll have plenty of fun, too, so why mind a little
hard work?&#8221;</p>
<p>After hunting in odd corners for their caps,
the boys finally found them all and departed gayly
on their way, only slightly depressed by the imminence
of the fall term at high school.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>LEARNING TO SEND</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got two customers for those sets we
wanted to sell,&#8221; announced Bob, a few evenings
later, when the radio boys had congregated at his
house as usual. &#8220;It was so easy, that I&#8217;ll bet we
could sell all we make, if we wanted to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s going to buy them?&#8221; asked Joe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dave Halley, who runs the barber shop near
the station, wants one, and there&#8217;s a big novelty
store on the next block whose owner will take the
other. I promised that we&#8217;d set the outfits up and
show them how to work them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s quick work, Bob,&#8221; laughed Herb.
&#8220;How did you come to land two customers so
quickly?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was getting a haircut in Dave&#8217;s shop, and
he told me that he was thinking of buying a good
set, but hated to spend the money. So I told him
that I could sell him a good practical set for quite
a little less than it would cost him in a store, and
he jumped at the offer. Then he told me about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
Hartmann, the owner of the new variety store.
Hartmann wants to get one because he thinks it
will draw trade. I went to see him as soon as
Dave got through telling me how much dandruff
I had and how much I needed some of his patent
tonic. Mr. Hartmann was a little doubtful at
first about buying a home made set, but I told
him if he wasn&#8217;t pleased with it he didn&#8217;t need to
pay us for it and we&#8217;d take it back. That seemed
to satisfy him, so he said he&#8217;d buy it. It was
dead easy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s certainly fine,&#8221; said Joe, admiringly.
&#8220;That will help a lot toward getting apparatus
for the new sets.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a hustler, Bob,&#8221; said Jimmy. &#8220;I&#8217;d
like to be one, but I guess I&#8217;m not built that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was more luck than anything else,&#8221; disclaimed
Bob. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go down to the store after
school to-morrow and pick out what we need. I
want a couple of audion bulbs, and I suppose you
fellows do, too. I want to price variable condensers
like the one Doctor Dale brought us at
Ocean Point last summer, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to keep busy if we want to keep
ahead of some of the other fellows in this town,&#8221;
said Joe. &#8220;Lots of the fellows at High have got
the radio fever bad, and are out to beat us at
our own game. I guess we can show them where
they get off, all right, but we may have to hustle
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
some to do it. I heard Lon Beardsley at noon
to-day boasting that he was going to be the first
fellow in Clintonia to receive signals from Europe.
I asked him what kind of set he intended
to do it with, and he said he had been working on
one all summer, and was putting the finishing
touches to it now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He ought to have something pretty good, if
he&#8217;s been working on it that long,&#8221; commented
Herb. &#8220;If one of us had been working on a set
all summer, I think we&#8217;d have had it done before
this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably we would. But you&#8217;ve got to remember
that we&#8217;ve had more experience at the
game than Lon,&#8221; Bob reminded him.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to me that we&#8217;d do better all to work
on one big, crackerjack set than each to make a
separate long distance set,&#8221; said Herb. &#8220;In the
first place, it&#8217;s more fun working together. And
then we could put our money together and get better
equipment than we could the other way. What
do you think?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a pretty good idea,&#8221; said Jimmy.
&#8220;You can hear just as much over one set as you
can over four, as far as that goes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinking of something like that myself,&#8221;
said Bob, slowly. &#8220;It would certainly cost us
less, and, as Herb says, we&#8217;d probably have a better
set in the end.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It suits me all right,&#8221; added Joe. &#8220;This is
going to be a tough term at High, and with so
much home work I don&#8217;t know where I&#8217;d get the
time to build a complicated set. It looks as
though we&#8217;d be better off every way, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You always will be better off, if you follow
my advice,&#8221; said Herb, with his customary modesty.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t usually have sense enough to
do it, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We have too much sense, you mean,&#8221; said
Jimmy, scornfully. &#8220;This suggestion of yours
was only an accident, Herb. Chances are you
won&#8217;t make another as good for the next year.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know that you&#8217;re very famous for
bright ideas, Jimmy, so where do you get off to
criticize?&#8221; asked Herb.</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh! I&#8217;ve got an idea in my noddle right now
that&#8217;s worth half a dozen of yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Prove it!&#8221; replied Herb, promptly. &#8220;What is
this bright idea?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you know that just about this time they
cook nice, hot doughnuts down at Mattatuck&#8217;s
bakery. Delicious doughnuts! Um, yum!&#8221; and
Jimmy&#8217;s round countenance assumed a rapturous
expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;And the idea was, that you&#8217;d go down there
and blow the crowd to hot doughnuts, was it?&#8221;
queried Joe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Blow, nothing!&#8221; exclaimed Jimmy. &#8220;We&#8217;ll all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
chip in. But I don&#8217;t mind going after them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The trouble is&mdash;can we trust you not to eat
them all on the way back?&#8221; Bob laughed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Anybody that doesn&#8217;t think so can go for his
own doughnuts,&#8221; replied Jimmy. &#8220;Kick in there,
you hobos, and I&#8217;ll be on my way. I&#8217;m getting
hungrier every minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>His friends, thus adjured, &#8220;kicked in,&#8221; and
Jimmy set off at a rate of speed much above his
usual leisurely gait. The bakery was three or
four blocks away, but Jimmy returned in a surprisingly
short time with a large bag of tender
doughnuts, still warm from the bakery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wow!&#8221; exclaimed Joe, as Jimmy tore open
the bag. &#8220;The sight of those doughnuts certainly
makes a fellow feel hungry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dig into them, fellows,&#8221; was Jimmy&#8217;s only
comment, as he reached for one himself.</p>
<p>They all followed this example, and the pile of
crisp brown doughnuts dwindled with surprising
rapidity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Likely enough these will keep me awake half
the night, but it&#8217;s worth it,&#8221; said Jimmy, with a
sigh of contentment, as he finished the last crumb
of his fourth doughnut. &#8220;I don&#8217;t feel near as
hungry as I did, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should hope that you didn&#8217;t feel hungry at
all, old greedy,&#8221; laughed Joe. &#8220;I&#8217;m beginning to
think that it&#8217;s impossible to fill you up any more.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, lay off!&#8221; retorted Jimmy. &#8220;You Indians
ate your full share, I notice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess we&#8217;re all in the same boat,&#8221; agreed
Bob. &#8220;But now that we&#8217;re fed up and feeling
strong, how would you like to practice sending for
awhile? I was just beginning to work up a little
speed while we were at Ocean Point, but now I
suppose I&#8217;m getting rusty again. Who&#8217;s game to
send? I&#8217;ll bet nobody can send faster than I can
receive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m willing to try it, anyway,&#8221; said Joe, picking
up a magazine. &#8220;I&#8217;ll send right out of this
magazine, so when you say &#8217;stop&#8217; we&#8217;ll be able to
check up how much you&#8217;ve caught.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, that&#8217;s fair enough,&#8221; agreed Bob.
&#8220;Just wait a minute until I get a paper and pencil,
then shoot as fast as you can.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seating himself at the table, with a blank sheet
of paper before him, Bob made ready to scribble
at high speed, while Herb held a watch to time
him. As for Jimmy, he was content to curl
up on a sofa and act the part of self-appointed
judge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Start sending as soon as you like, Joe,&#8221; said,
Jimmy. &#8220;I&#8217;m all ready for you. I&#8217;ll bet I can
fall asleep before you can send fifty words.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t take that bet, because I believe you
can,&#8221; replied Joe. &#8220;I&#8217;d be betting against your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
specialty, and there&#8217;s no percentage in that, you
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget me, though, will you?&#8221; said Bob,
in a resigned tone. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to hurry you,
but any time you&#8217;re both through that interesting
conversation I&#8217;m waiting to begin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, then, here goes!&#8221; said Joe, and
started sending as rapidly as he could with the
practice key and buzzer.</p>
<p>Bob&#8217;s pencil fairly flew over the paper, and for
five minutes there was no sound in the room save
the strident buzz of the sender and the whisper of
Bob&#8217;s pencil as it moved rapidly over the paper.</p>
<p>Then, &#8220;Time,&#8221; called Herb, and Bob threw
down the pencil.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; he exclaimed, reaching for a handkerchief.
&#8220;That&#8217;s pretty hot work, if any one
should ask you. Count &#8217;em up, Herb, will you,
and see how many there are? Seems to me there
must be a million words there, more or less.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite a little less,&#8221; laughed Herb, after he had
counted the words as requested. &#8220;But you&#8217;ve
written ninety-one, which is mighty good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a little over sixteen a minute,&#8221; said
Bob. &#8220;It&#8217;s not near as fast as I want to get, but
it&#8217;s fast enough to get a license, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet it is!&#8221; exclaimed Herb. &#8220;And there
are very few mistakes,&#8221; he added, as he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
compared what Bob had written with the magazine
text.</p>
<p>&#8220;Joe&#8217;s getting to be some bear at sending, too,&#8221;
remarked Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the sending is a lot easier than receiving,&#8221;
said Joe. &#8220;But now, if you don&#8217;t mind, Bob, you
can send me something, and I&#8217;ll see how fast I
can take it. I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t come up to your
record, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>Joe did very well, however, averaging about
fourteen words a minute.</p>
<p>Then Herb took a turn at sending and receiving,
as did Jimmy, and they both did well. The
boys found it all very fascinating, as well as useful,
and discussed many plans for the future, although
they did not intend to go in much for
sending until they had perfected a first-class receiving
set. They agreed before parting for the
night that they would meet the following day
after school at the radio supply store, where they
could buy some audion bulbs and whatever other
apparatus they might need.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>A RATTLING FIGHT</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Bob! what kept you so late?&#8221; called
Joe. He and Herb and Jimmy had been waiting
some time for their friend, and were beginning to
think that he must have forgotten the appointment
made the previous night.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a wonder I got here as soon as I did,&#8221; replied
Bob. His face was flushed, and there was
an angry gleam in his eyes. &#8220;I thought I&#8217;d have
to lick Carl Lutz before I could get here; but he
didn&#8217;t have quite nerve enough to start anything,
as he was all alone. I only wish he had.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What happened?&#8221; asked Joe. &#8220;Tell us about
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I came out this afternoon, Carl was
standing just outside the schoolyard gate, teasing
that little Yates kid, whose brother was killed in
the Argonne fighting. If Bill had been alive, you
can bet Carl would have left the kid brother alone,
but as it was, he was bullying him and trying to
make him carry a big package for him.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Just like the big coward!&#8221; exclaimed Joe, indignantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;You said it!&#8221; replied Bob. &#8220;Well, of course,
I wasn&#8217;t going to stand for anything like that, and
I made him quit. He got so mad that I really
thought he was going to swing at me, but he
didn&#8217;t quite have the nerve. He went off muttering
something about getting the gang after me,
and I took the Yates kid with me for a few blocks
to make sure that he would get home all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good for you!&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;That&#8217;s just like
Carl, to pick on a kid that has nobody to fight his
battles for him and is too small to fight his own.
I&#8217;m glad you were around to take the kid&#8217;s part.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose Carl will run right to Buck, now,
and they&#8217;ll hatch up some scheme to get even with
you,&#8221; remarked Herb.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care what they do,&#8221; returned Bob.
&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad there&#8217;s a bunch like that in this
town. They&#8217;re a regular nuisance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve done all we could to teach them manners,&#8221;
said Joe. &#8220;I guess the trouble is, they
don&#8217;t want to learn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let&#8217;s bother even thinking about them,&#8221;
said Bob. &#8220;Come on in and we&#8217;ll buy the stuff
we need.&#8221;</p>
<p>The four friends went on into the store, where
they found several of their schoolmates, bent on
the same mission as themselves. All exchanged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
greetings, and many good-natured jokes were
bandied back and forth as they made their purchases.</p>
<p>&#8220;You fellows will have to step lively to get
ahead of me,&#8221; said Lon Beardsley, who was older
than any of the radio boys and was in the senior
class at High School. He was one of the brightest
boys in his class, and the others knew that
competition from him was not to be despised.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stepping fast is one of the best things we do,&#8221;
said, Bob, in answer to this friendly challenge.
&#8220;You may be some speed, but we&#8217;re not such
slouches, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do your worst! We defy you!&#8221; cried Herb,
striking a melodramatic attitude.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Lon, laughing. &#8220;Remember,
though, I&#8217;ve given you fair warning. I see you&#8217;re
buying vacuum tubes,&#8221; he added, curiously.
&#8220;You must be going in pretty deep, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ask us no questions and we&#8217;ll tell you no
lies,&#8221; parried Bob. &#8220;Besides, we&#8217;re not the only
radio fans in this town, Lon. Maybe some one
else will beat us all out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m not worrying,&#8221; said the other, as he
prepared to leave with his purchases. &#8220;Are you
fellows going my way?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better not wait for us,&#8221; replied Bob.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve got a few things to get yet. See you at
school to-morrow.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Righto!&#8221; said Lon, and departed, whistling
cheerfully.</p>
<p>The radio boys started home soon afterward,
The days were getting very short, and by the
time they left the store the autumn evening was
rapidly fading into night. There was a crisp
tang in the air which, together with the smell of
burning leaves, gave warning that winter was
close at hand. The last gorgeous colors of an
autumn sunset still tinged the western rim of the
sky as the boys set out for home at a rapid pace.</p>
<p>Not far from their homes they struck off from
the street through a vacant lot, following a path
that served as a short cut. The lot was overgrown
with weeds and high sunflower stalks, but
the idea of an ambush never entered the boys&#8217;
heads until suddenly they were assailed by a
shower of stones, which sang viciously past their
ears. Fortunately, it was too dark for their assailants
to throw the missiles with any accuracy,
although the boys were struck more than once.</p>
<p>For a moment, taken completely by surprise,
they did not know which way to turn nor what
to do. But they were not of the type that hesitates
long before taking action. Their hidden assailants
probably thought that they would run,
but this thought was furthest from their minds.</p>
<p>Bob noted from which direction the missiles
were coming, and acted accordingly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, fellows!&#8221; he yelled, and, followed
by his friends, charged into the long dry stalks
that fringed the path.</p>
<p>There was a sudden cessation in the volley of
stones and a startled rustling deep in the rank
growth of weeds.</p>
<p>In grim silence the radio boys charged straight
in the direction of this sound, and such was the
speed of their attack that their hidden adversaries
had no chance to make their escape before
the boys were upon them. It was now almost
dark, but there was still enough light for the boys
to recognize the ungainly form of Buck Looker,
in company with his cronies. These three had
been re-inforced by a boy of about Buck&#8217;s age,
and of very much the same ugly disposition,
known as Bud Hayes, whose family had lately
moved to Clintonia.</p>
<p>&#8220;Clean them up, fellows!&#8221; yelled Bob. &#8220;We&#8217;ll
teach them not to throw stones again in a hurry!&#8221;</p>
<p>Each of the radio boys singled out an adversary,
and a brisk mêlée ensued. Seeing that they
could not get away, the Looker crowd put up the
best fight they could. But the radio boys were
wrought up to a high pitch of anger by the cowardly
attack on them, and they fought with a quiet
and grim determination that quickly put their adversaries
on the defensive.</p>
<p>At first the high grass and weeds hampered all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
the combatants, but these were soon trampled
down as they fought savagely back and forth.
Suddenly, by some unfortunate accident, Herb
tripped over some object lying on the ground, and
fell full length. With a cry of triumph, Bud
Hayes, without giving Herb a chance to get to
his feet again, threw himself down on top of him
and started pommeling him for all he was worth.
Stunned by his fall, Herb at first could offer little
resistance, and it would have gone hard with
him had not Bob observed his fall. He himself
had engaged Buck in combat, but as he saw Herb
go down, he dealt Buck a staggering blow on the
point of the jaw and leaped to Herb&#8217;s assistance.</p>
<p>Hot rage filled his heart and the wild thrill of
combat tingled along every nerve. With the
strength and ferocity of a panther he hurled himself
at Bud Hayes, landing with such force that
Bud was hurled several feet away from the prostrate
Herb, gasping for breath.</p>
<p>Bob himself landed on the ground, but was on
his feet again quick as lightning, glancing about
him to see how it fared with his friends. Joe
was forcing Carl Lutz back step by step, while
Jimmy had already forced Terry Mooney to take
to his heels. But even as Bob noted this in one
quick glance, both Bud and Buck, who had recovered
by this time, rushed at him from different
directions. But before Buck could get too close
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
quarters Herb, who was recovering from the effect
of his fall, stretched out a foot, and Buck
sprawled headlong, landing with such force that
the breath was knocked from his body.</p>
<p>Lutz and Hayes, seeing their leader fall, decided
that it was time for them to get away, and
simultaneously they took to their heels. By this
time it had grown so dark that it was impossible
to follow them, so the boys were left in undisputed
possession of the field.</p>
<p>Buck Looker, deserted by his cowardly friends,
staggered to his feet, all the fight knocked out of
him. He was entirely at the mercy of the radio
boys, but they were not the kind to take advantage
of this fact, although, undoubtedly, had their
positions been reversed, Buck would have had no
such scruples.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you&#8217;ve got me,&#8221; growled Buck. &#8220;What
are you going to do about it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; said Bob, a note of contempt in his
voice. &#8220;The less we see of you, Buck, the better
we&#8217;re satisfied. And your gang&#8217;s no better than
you are. Look at the way they ran off and left
you to take care of yourself. You&#8217;re dirty and
they&#8217;re dirty. We&#8217;ll let you off this time with the
licking you&#8217;ve had already, but if you ever try
any more low-down tricks you won&#8217;t get off so
easily.&#8221;</p>
<p>Buck muttered something to himself which he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
did not dare to voice aloud, and slunk off with the
manner of a cur who has just received a beating
that he knows he deserves. The radio boys
groped their way back to the path, where they had
left their bundles, and resumed their way home,
keeping a wary eye out for any signs of a renewal
of the attack by their enemies.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>LARRY REAPPEARS</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;That was a regular battle,&#8221; said Herb, as
they walked along. &#8220;Bud Hayes has some reputation
as a scrapper, and he certainly was all that
I could handle, but if I hadn&#8217;t tripped over that
blamed can I could have taken care of him all
right. But I&#8217;ve got a lump on my head as big
as a hen&#8217;s egg where I hit the ground.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d have been out of luck if Bob hadn&#8217;t
helped you out the way he did,&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;You
certainly landed on him like a load of bricks,
Bob.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was so mad that I think I would have
dropped a ton of bricks on him if I&#8217;d had them
handy,&#8221; replied Bob, with a grim laugh. &#8220;That
was one dirty trick&mdash;hitting Herb&mdash;when he was
knocked out by that fall.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I owe you a vote of thanks for that,
too,&#8221; said Herb.</p>
<p>&#8220;I owe you one, for tripping up Buck in the
neat way you did,&#8221; returned Bob. &#8220;He and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
Hayes would have been on top of me both together
if you hadn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No thanks due; it was a pleasure,&#8221; grinned
Herb, although a swollen lip made this exercise
painful. &#8220;I wish he&#8217;d broken his neck while he
was about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t your fault that he didn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew that bunch was mean,&#8221; remarked Joe.
&#8220;But I never thought they were mean enough to
take up stone throwing from ambush. That&#8217;s the
most cowardly thing they&#8217;ve ever done.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and the most dangerous,&#8221; said Bob.
&#8220;Any one of those stones might have killed one
of us if it had landed just right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or, worse still, it might have broken our vacuum
tubes,&#8221; added Jimmy, with a grin. &#8220;It&#8217;s a
wonder that the whole lot of them didn&#8217;t get
smashed. I&#8217;ll be afraid to open the package when
we do get it home,&#8221; he went on more seriously.</p>
<p>His fears turned out to have been groundless,
for when they arrived at the Layton home, without
having seen or heard anything more of the
bullies on the way, they found all their delicate
apparatus unharmed. And other than Herb&#8217;s
swollen lip and a few slight bruises, they had received
little damage themselves from the encounter.
The bullies had not fared so well, for little
was seen of them for several days, and when they
did make an appearance in public they were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
decorated with strips of court plaster here and there.
They offered many ingenious excuses in explanation,
but they received little credence from the
other boys of the town, who had been apprized
of the cowardly attack on the radio boys and the
result of the encounter.</p>
<p>The bullies soon found that nobody believed
them, and wherever they went they were pointed
out and were the subject of many jeers and jokes,
although few dared to make them openly. Buck
realized that he was losing prestige rapidly, and,
although he was getting secretly to fear another
encounter with the radio boys, he felt that he
must soon get the better of them if he were to
regain his former reputation as a fighter. He
and his cronies spent many an hour in hatching
plots against Bob and his friends, but for a long
time could think of nothing that offered much
prospect of success.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the radio boys were going about
the building of their big set with enthusiasm,
spending all their spare time at the fascinating
pursuit. Most of their work was done at Bob&#8217;s
house, as he had an ideal workroom in the cellar,
and his position as leader, moreover, made it seem
the natural place for them to meet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, fellows!&#8221; exclaimed Jimmy one evening,
tumbling down the cellar stairs three steps at a
time, &#8220;have you heard the news?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What news?&#8221; asked Herb, who had arrived
only a few minutes before him. &#8220;Has there been
a big fire? Or did some one die and leave you
a million dollars?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No such luck as that,&#8221; replied Jimmy. &#8220;But
I know you&#8217;ll be mighty glad to hear it, anyway.
Chasson&#8217;s vaudeville is going to be in Clintonia
next week. That&#8217;s the show Larry and Tim are
with, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good enough!&#8221; exclaimed the others. &#8220;Where
did you hear about it, Jimmy?&#8221; asked Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a bill poster putting up the programme
on a fence as I came along,&#8221; answered
Jimmy. &#8220;I saw the name &#8217;Chasson,&#8217; and of
course I stopped and looked to see if Larry and
Tim were on the bill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Were they?&#8221; asked Herb.</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet they were! And in pretty big type,
too,&#8221; responded Jimmy. &#8220;Say! it will be great
to see them on the stage, won&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say it will,&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;If they&#8217;re
half as funny on the stage as they are off it,
they&#8217;ll surely make a hit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They certainly will,&#8221; put in Bob. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be
there on the opening night to give them a hand.
If they don&#8217;t go big, it won&#8217;t be our fault.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll be popular, all right,&#8221; predicted Joe,
with conviction. &#8220;If the rest of the show is half
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
as good as their part it will be worth more than
the price of admission.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be great to hear that canary whistling
his little tunes again,&#8221; said Herbert, laughing at
the recollection of Larry&#8217;s comical imitations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not to mention Tim&#8217;s dancing,&#8221; said Bob.
&#8220;That boy can sure shake a foot. I&#8217;ll bet they&#8217;ll
both get into the big circuits before they&#8217;re much
older.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They deserve to,&#8221; said Jimmy. &#8220;They rehearse
an awful lot. It makes me tired just to
think of how hard I&#8217;ve seen them work sometimes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But then, you get tired very easily, Doughnuts,
you know that,&#8221; said Joe.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you worked half as hard in the afternoons
as I do sometimes, you&#8217;d be tired in the evening,
too,&#8221; replied Jimmy, in an injured tone. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
bet I sawed through about a thousand feet of
tough oak planking this afternoon for Dad, and
I&#8217;ll have to do the same thing to-morrow afternoon.
He&#8217;s got a big job on, and I have to pitch
in and help him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you ought to do something to pay for
all the good grub you pack away,&#8221; said Herb, utterly
without sympathy for his friend&#8217;s tale of
woe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you&#8217;d pack away more if you did a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
little work once in a while,&#8221; retorted Jimmy. &#8220;All
you do is spend your time thinking up poor jokes
instead of doing something useful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m glad you mentioned jokes,&#8221; said Herb,
calmly ignoring Jimmy&#8217;s attack. &#8220;I thought of
a swell one just as I was walking up here this
evening. I know you will all be delighted to hear
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What makes you so sure?&#8221; asked Bob. &#8220;They
don&#8217;t usually delight anybody, do they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course they do,&#8221; replied Herb, indignantly.</p>
<p>&#8220;They always delight Herb Fennington, anyway,&#8221;
observed Joe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I like me,&#8221; said Herb, refusing to get
mad. &#8220;Also, I like my jokes. Now, take this
one, for instance. Why&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d rather not take it, if it&#8217;s all the same to
you,&#8221; said Joe, cruelly. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you keep it,
and give it to somebody else, Herb?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, forget it!&#8221; exclaimed Herb. &#8220;This is a
good joke, I tell you, and you&#8217;ve got to listen,
whether you want to or not.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go ahead and get the agony over with, then,&#8221;
said Bob, resignedly. &#8220;I suppose we&#8217;ll be able to
live through it, just as we have others before
this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I saw in this morning&#8217;s newspaper that
the Mercury Athletic Club in New York burned
up last night. Now, you&#8217;ve got to help me out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
with this joke, Bob. When I say &#8216;I see there was
a big athletic event at the Mercury Athletic Club
last night,&#8217; you say &#8216;is that so? What happened?&#8217;
Have you got that through your noddle?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I guess I can remember that,&#8221; answered
Bob. &#8220;Shoot!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, then, here goes,&#8221; said Herb. &#8220;I
see that there was a big athletic event at the Mercury
Athletic Club last night, Bob.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221; said Bob, taking his cue. &#8220;What
happened, Herb?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The water was running and the flames were
leaping,&#8221; cried Herb, triumphantly. &#8220;How&#8217;s
that for a crackerjack joke?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Awful,&#8221; said Joe, although he could not help
laughing with the others. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet there&#8217;s a nice
cosy, padded cell waiting for you in the nearest
bughouse, Herb.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it can wait, for all of me,&#8221; said his
friend. &#8220;I&#8217;m not very keen about it, myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think jail would be a better place for him,&#8221;
suggested Jimmy.</p>
<p>This met with the unqualified approval of
everybody except Herb, and then the boys set to
work on their new radio set. As this was Saturday
evening, they had no lessons to prepare,
and they worked steadily until ten o&#8217;clock. They
wound transformers until Jimmy declared that it
made him dizzy even to look at them, and when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
the time came to stop work they all felt that substantial
progress had been made.</p>
<p>They agreed to meet at the theater the following
Monday evening, to witness the opening performance
of the show in which their friends
Larry Bartlett and Tim Barcommon were performing,
and then said good-night and started
homeward to the accompaniment of a cheerful
whistled marching tune.</p>
<p>There was much excitement among their classmates
the following Monday, as they had all
heard about the show and most of them intended
to go. When they learned that the radio boys
were acquainted with two of the performers, the
four lads were deluged with questions as to how
they came to know them.</p>
<p>&#8220;You fellows are getting pretty sporty, seems
to me,&#8221; said Lon Beardsley. &#8220;Maybe you&#8217;ll give
us an introduction to your friends in the show.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Surest thing you know,&#8221; assented Bob. &#8220;I
got a letter from them this morning, and they
promised to call me up around four o&#8217;clock this
afternoon. They&#8217;ll probably come to our house
for dinner, and we&#8217;ll all go down to the theater
together.&#8221;</p>
<p>And sure enough, Bob had hardly reached
home that afternoon when the telephone bell rang,
and Larry&#8217;s familiar voice came over the wire.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Bob!&#8221; he said. &#8220;How&#8217;s the boy?
Did you get my letter all right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I sure did,&#8221; answered Bob. &#8220;It&#8217;s fine to hear
your voice again. We&#8217;re all tickled to death to
know that you&#8217;re showing in Clintonia this week.
You and Tim have got to come here for supper
to-night, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d be glad to, if it isn&#8217;t imposing on your
folks,&#8221; said Larry. &#8220;We don&#8217;t get many regular
home dinners these days, you can bet, and it will
be a treat for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, then, we&#8217;ll be looking for you,&#8221; replied
Bob. &#8220;Get here as early as you can.&#8221;</p>
<p>This Larry promised to do, and after a little
further conversation rang off. Bob then called
up the other radio boys and told them to come to
his house immediately after supper, so that they
would have time for a few words with Larry and
Tim, after which they could all go down to the
theater together.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Hello, Tim! Hello, Larry! How have you
been?&#8221; The two actors had little reason to complain
of the warmth of their reception, as the
radio boys shook hands with them, pounded them
on the back, and asked innumerable questions.</p>
<p>&#8220;You both look as though you were being
treated all right,&#8221; said Joe, after they had quieted
down somewhat after the first riotous greetings.
&#8220;How do you like being with a regular show?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we manage to get along,&#8221; answered Larry.
&#8220;But tell us a little of what you fellows have been
doing since we saw you last. Are you still as interested
in radio as ever?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet we are!&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;If you once get
interested in that, I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;d ever be
willing to drop it. The more you learn about it,
the more you want to learn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s fine,&#8221; said Larry, heartily. &#8220;I
only wish I had time enough to take it up. I&#8217;d
like nothing better.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span></p>
<p>&#8220;When you make a lot of money in the vaudeville
business and retire, you&#8217;ll have plenty of
time for it,&#8221; said Tim, with a wink at the others.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, when I do,&#8221; said Larry, scornfully. &#8220;It
doesn&#8217;t strain my back at present to carry around
my roll, though. I feel lucky if I can keep a
jump or two ahead of the wolf, as it is. But
we may both have luck and land on a big circuit,
and then we&#8217;ll begin to get some real money.&#8221;</p>
<p>While talking, the little party had been walking
at a brisk pace and now found themselves close
to the theater. Many of the townspeople were
going in the same direction, and most of these
recognized the radio boys and looked inquisitively
at their two companions. Some of their schoolmates,
who knew that Larry and Tim were actors,
made bold to join the group and be introduced.
By the time they reached the theater Larry and
Tim had quite an escort of honor, all of whom
were loath to leave them at the stage door. As
they disappeared within they were followed by
three rousing cheers, and then all the boys made
their way to the main entrance.</p>
<p>The radio boys had secured their tickets in advance,
and were soon comfortably seated, waiting
expectantly for the curtain to rise on the first
act.</p>
<p>This proved to be an acrobatic turn of mediocre
quality, and the boys waited impatiently for it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
to finish, for Tim and Larry were billed to appear
in the next act. With a moderate meed of
applause, the acrobats retired. The orchestra
struck up a catchy tune and the big curtain slowly
rose. The scene disclosed was pretty and artistic,
representing a glade in a forest, realistic trees
surrounding a green clearing. Nothing was to
be seen of Larry and Tim, however, and the radio
boys were mystified, as both their friends had refused
to tell them what the act was like. Suddenly
the first piping notes of a canary bird&#8217;s song
were heard, rising so clear and lifelike that even
the boys themselves were deluded at first into
thinking that they were listening to an actual bird.
The canary song ended with a sustained trill, and
then, soft and melodious, came the limpid notes
of the mocking bird&#8217;s song. By this time the audience
had comprehended that this was in reality
a clever human imitation of bird notes, and they
applauded heartily.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say!&#8221; whispered Jimmy, excitedly, &#8220;Larry
has picked up a lot of new stuff since he was at
Ocean Point. That was fine, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep still,&#8221; whispered Joe, fiercely. &#8220;We
want to hear every bit of this.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jimmy subsided, and they all listened with keen
delight as Larry imitated a host of feathered
songsters, each one so true to life that the audience
applauded again and again. At last Larry
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
exhausted his repertoire, and for the first time
appeared in the open, emerging from behind the
trunk of a tree. He was heartily applauded, and
as he bowed his way off the stage, the spotlight
shifted, and Tim came onto the stage like a whirlwind,
arms and legs flying as he did a complicated
clog dance. At the most furious part Larry
joined him, and they danced together, keeping
such perfect time and going through such identical
motions that it seemed as though they must
be automatons actuated by the same string.</p>
<p>As a spectacular finale to the act, each one was
supposed to make a dash for one of the property
trees in the background, climb up it and disappear
in the branches as the curtain fell. With a final
wild gyration that brought spontaneous applause
from the audience, each one made for his appointed
tree, and started up.</p>
<p>Everything went as usual until Larry had almost
reached the branches. Suddenly there came
a cracking sound, the artificial tree swayed and
tottered, and, amid horrified cries from the spectators,
crashed to the stage, bringing down others
on top of it as it fell. The radio boys had just
time to see Larry lying, white and senseless,
among the ruins when the curtain descended
quickly, shutting off the scene of the accident
from the audience.</p>
<p>So suddenly had the thing happened that at first
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
the boys could hardly believe the evidence of their
eyes. For a few moments they gazed at one another
in horrified silence, and then, as though all
were moved simultaneously by the same thought,
they rushed down the aisle and, before the ushers
could stop them, climbed onto the stage. It took
them a few seconds, that seemed like hours, to
find their way behind the scenes to the place where
the accident had occurred.</p>
<p>Tim, aided by several stage hands, was frantically
trying to release his partner from the heavy
pieces of scenery that held him pinned down.
Bob and his friends fell to the work of rescue
with every ounce of energy and strength that they
possessed, but, work as they did, it was a considerable
time before they at last managed to free
their unfortunate friend.</p>
<p>A doctor had been sent for, and by the time
Larry was laid, still unconscious, on a cot, the
physician had arrived. As he made his examination
his face grew more and more serious, and he
shook his head doubtfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s pretty badly hurt, I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;We must get him to a hospital as soon as possible.
I have my car outside, and if some of you
will carry him out, I&#8217;ll take him there.&#8221;</p>
<p>In sorrowful silence Tim and the radio boys
carried their injured friend out to the doctor&#8217;s
automobile. Tim got in with him, and Larry was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
whirled away to the hospital, where he faced a
grim fight for life.</p>
<p>The radio boys followed on foot, after first telephoning
to their homes to explain why they
would not be home until late.</p>
<p>Meantime, in the theater, the performance had
gone on after an announcement by the management
that &#8220;Mr. Bartlett is but slightly hurt,&#8221;&mdash;so
spoke the manager&mdash;&#8220;and has been taken to a
hospital where he can receive better care than in
the hotel.&#8221;</p>
<p>The radio boys followed the doctor&#8217;s car to the
hospital and spent an anxious hour in the waiting
room while their friend was being thoroughly examined
by the head physician, for of course the
announcement at the theater had been made to
quiet the audience, and no one yet knew just how
serious Larry&#8217;s injuries were.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to get Doctor Ellis to take care
of him,&#8221; said Bob, while they were waiting.
&#8220;I&#8217;m awfully sorry your father isn&#8217;t in town, Joe.
Next to him Dr. Ellis is the best doctor in Clintonia,
I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>The others concurred in this view, and Bob
promised to call up Dr. Ellis in the morning.
After what seemed an endless wait the physician
who had brought Larry to the hospital entered
the waiting room.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you won&#8217;t be able to see your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
friend to-night,&#8221; he said. &#8220;His left arm is
broken, and I think his back is injured, although
I can&#8217;t tell yet how seriously. By this time to-morrow
night I&#8217;ll be able to tell you more. Has
he any relatives that should be notified of the
accident?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know he has a mother, who is dependent on
him,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;We&#8217;ve all heard him speak of
her. I don&#8217;t know where she lives, though, but
probably Tim would have her address.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Whose address?&#8221; asked Tim, entering the
room at that moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Larry&#8217;s mother&#8217;s,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;Do you know
where she lives, Tim? As the doctor says, she
ought to be notified about this.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know where she can be reached,&#8221; said
Tim. &#8220;I&#8217;ll write to her before I go to bed to-night.
Poor Larry!&#8221; and Tim tried hard to wink
the tears back, but with little success.</p>
<p>&#8220;You mustn&#8217;t feel too bad,&#8221; advised the kindly
doctor. &#8220;I think that there is little doubt that
he will live, but as to whether or not he&#8217;ll fully
recover, I can&#8217;t say yet. But we&#8217;ll hope for the
best, and you can rest assured that everything
possible will be done for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys thanked the doctor for the help he
had given their unfortunate friend, and then,
after taking a sorrowful leave of Tim, started
homeward.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></p>
<p>The next few days were anxious ones for the
radio boys. Larry hovered between life and
death, and almost a week had passed before the
doctors in charge of his case would say positively
that he was going to pull through. At the end
of that period the boys were allowed to see him,
for a few minutes, after promising not to let him
talk or to say anything to him that might excite
him.</p>
<p>Larry received them with his old cheerful grin,
but the boys were shocked at his wan and wasted
appearance, so different from his usual vigorous
self. They did not let him see this, however, but
talked and joked with him in the usual way, and
when the doctor finally signaled for them to leave
they had the satisfaction of knowing that they had
cheered their friend up and left him looking happier
than when they came.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>LIGHT OUT OF DARKNESS</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be pretty hard for Larry when
he does start to get around, I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221; said
Bob, after the boys had left the hospital. &#8220;Tim
told me yesterday that Larry&#8217;s mother is an invalid,
and has to have a nurse all the time. Larry
is her only support, and if he can&#8217;t keep up his
vaudeville career I don&#8217;t see how either of them
are going to get along.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty tough, all right,&#8221; replied Joe.
&#8220;The doctor says now that he&#8217;ll be as strong as
ever eventually, but he admits that it will be a
long time until he is. I wish we could think of
some way to help Larry out until he gets on his
feet again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, maybe we can,&#8221; observed Bob, hopefully.
&#8220;Although I must admit that I can&#8217;t see
much light on the subject just at present.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll have to get busy on our new radio set
in earnest pretty soon,&#8221; said Joe, after a pause in
which each had been busy with his own thoughts.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
&#8220;We&#8217;ve spent so much of our time at the hospital
with Larry that we haven&#8217;t got more than about
ten cents&#8217; worth done since the night of the accident.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We can plug right along with it now,&#8221; said
Bob. &#8220;And speaking of radio, who do you think
called me up last night? I meant to tell you before,
but I forgot all about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was it?&#8221; asked Herb. &#8220;Somebody we
all know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet we all know him,&#8221; said Bob, laughing.
&#8220;It was Frank Brandon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Frank Brandon!&#8221; they all exclaimed.
&#8220;Where&#8217;s he been keeping himself lately?&#8221; asked
Joe.</p>
<p>&#8220;He said that he had had to go to Florida on
some government business connected with wireless,
and he just got back to this part of the country
yesterday,&#8221; replied Bob. &#8220;He expected to be
in Clintonia to-day, and said that if we were all
going to be at my house to-night, he&#8217;d drop in
and make us a visit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you told him that we&#8217;d be there,&#8221; said
Jimmy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I did,&#8221; replied Bob. &#8220;You fellows
had better get around bright and early this evening,
because he said he&#8217;d be around right after
supper. I know I&#8217;ve got plenty of questions I
want to ask him, and I guess you have, too.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You can bet I have!&#8221; exclaimed Jimmy. &#8220;I
want to ask him where he got that package of
milk chocolate he had with him the last time I saw
him. He gave me a piece, and believe me, it was
about the best I&#8217;ve ever tasted.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There you go again,&#8221; exclaimed Herb, with a
laugh, &#8220;always thinking of that stomach of
yours. Don&#8217;t you ever think of anything
serious?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Serious?&#8221; echoed Jimmy. &#8220;It&#8217;s a serious
enough thing for me, where to get that milk chocolate.
I&#8217;ve been in pretty nearly every candy
store in town, but none of them seems to have
anything quite so good.&#8221;</p>
<p>By this time the boys had reached Main Street,
and they parted for the time being, promising to
get to Bob&#8217;s house as soon as they could after
supper.</p>
<p>The Layton family had hardly finished their
evening meal when there came a ring at the doorbell,
and Bob jumped up to admit the expected
guest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Mr. Brandon!&#8221; exclaimed Bob, as they
both shook hands heartily. &#8220;It seems great to see
you again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can say the same thing about you,&#8221; replied
Frank Brandon. &#8220;You&#8217;re tanned like a life guard
at Coney Island. I&#8217;ll bet you haven&#8217;t been far
from salt water all summer.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right there,&#8221; smiled Bob. &#8220;I was in
the water so much that it&#8217;s a wonder I didn&#8217;t turn
into a fish. The whole bunch of us had a wonderful
time of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good enough!&#8221; Brandon exclaimed, heartily.
&#8220;Where&#8217;s all the rest of your crowd this evening?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll be around soon now. I&#8217;m expecting
them any minute. There&#8217;s Joe&#8217;s whistle now!
I thought he&#8217;d be along soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he finished speaking Joe came bounding up
the porch two steps at a time, and he had hardly
got inside and shaken hands with Brandon when
Jimmy and Herb appeared together. There was
great excitement while they exchanged greetings,
and then they went into the parlor and were made
welcome by Mr. and Mrs. Layton.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems good to get back in this town again,&#8221;
said Brandon, in a voice that carried conviction.
&#8220;You folks have made me so welcome ever since
we became acquainted that it seems almost like my
own home town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way we want everybody to feel,&#8221;
smiled Mr. Layton. &#8220;Clintonia is a neighborly
town, and we always do our best to make visitors
feel at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hear you&#8217;ve done a good deal of traveling
since you were here last,&#8221; said Mrs. Layton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I had a little commission to execute for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
the government down in Miami,&#8221; said Brandon.
&#8220;A radio inspector is apt to be sent anywhere on
short notice, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How is your cousin, Mr. Harvey, getting
along?&#8221; asked Bob. &#8220;Has he got entirely over
his experience of last summer, when Dan Cassey
knocked him out and stole his money?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, he&#8217;s all right now,&#8221; responded Brandon.
&#8220;I saw him only day before yesterday, and
he couldn&#8217;t get through talking about the way you
fellows took charge of the station while he was
down and out, and then got the money back afterward.
That was mighty fine work, and you can
believe both he and I are grateful to you for what
you did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that wasn&#8217;t much,&#8221; disclaimed Bob. &#8220;Besides,
he&#8217;d done so much for us that we owed him
something in return.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t say anything about that,&#8221; observed
Brandon.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose that&#8217;s the last thing in the world he
would mention,&#8221; laughed Joe. &#8220;But he gave us
all kinds of stuff on radio, and even loaned us a
practice set to get the code with.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget about the motor boat,&#8221; said Herb.
&#8220;He was as generous with that as with everything
else. We sure had some fine cruises in the old
Sea Bird.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds like him, all right,&#8221; admitted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
Brandon. &#8220;There&#8217;s hardly anything you could
ask him for that he wouldn&#8217;t cheerfully give you.
He told me that you fellows were getting to be
regular sharps at the radio game. Are you
building any sets at present?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet we are!&#8221; cried Bob. &#8220;Come on down
to my workroom, and we&#8217;ll show you what we&#8217;re
doing. We&#8217;re working on a regular set this
time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m with you,&#8221; said Brandon, heartily.
&#8220;Come ahead and let&#8217;s see what you&#8217;ve got. I
suppose you&#8217;ll be giving me pointers pretty soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not for a little time yet, anyway,&#8221; grinned
Bob. &#8220;The government hasn&#8217;t been after us yet
begging us to take jobs in the radio department.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You never can tell,&#8221; replied Brandon.
&#8220;There&#8217;s a big demand for radio men these days,
and we&#8217;re getting some pretty young chaps in our
division.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t feel as though we&#8217;d much more than
scratched the surface of radiophony yet,&#8221; said
Joe. &#8220;There&#8217;s such an immense amount to be
learned, and then there are new discoveries being
made every day. It would take almost all a fellow&#8217;s
time just to keep up with new developments,
let alone learn all the fundamentals.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That will all come in time,&#8221; said the radio inspector.
&#8220;You&#8217;re on the right road now, anyway,
and traveling pretty fast. Say!&#8221; he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
exclaimed, a moment later, as he was ushered into
the workroom and caught sight of the new set,
which was partially completed. &#8220;You&#8217;re certainly
going into it pretty heavily this time, aren&#8217;t
you? I didn&#8217;t imagine you were working up
anything so elaborate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We thought we might as well make something
pretty good while we were about it,&#8221; said Bob.
&#8220;It won&#8217;t be much more work to make this set
than a smaller one, and we expect to get a whole
lot better results. Don&#8217;t you think so yourself?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no doubt about it,&#8221; agreed Mr. Brandon.
&#8220;When you get this set finished, you ought
to be able to catch pretty near anything that happens
to be flying around. Let&#8217;s see how you intend
to hook things up.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys explained their ideas and methods in
detail, while the radio man nodded appreciatively
from time to time. Sometimes he interrupted to
ask a question or make a suggestion, which was
duly taken note of by the enthusiastic boys.</p>
<p>&#8220;There doesn&#8217;t seem to be a whole lot that I
can tell you,&#8221; remarked Frank Brandon, after
they had gone over everything in detail. &#8220;You
seem to have thought it out very thoroughly already,
and outside of the few minor things I&#8217;ve
already told you, I can&#8217;t think of much to suggest.
It looks to me as though you&#8217;d have a
pretty good set there when you get through.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s one tip I want to give you though,&#8221;
he went on. &#8220;And that is to be careful about
your tuning. You&#8217;ve noticed, no doubt, that
sometimes you get first-class results, and then
again the reception is so unsatisfactory that you
are disgusted. Now in nine times out of ten the
whole trouble is that you haven&#8217;t tuned your receiver
properly. You can&#8217;t do the thing in a
haphazard fashion and get the signals clearly.
You know what Michelangelo said about &#8216;trifles
that make perfection.&#8217; Well, it&#8217;s something like
that in tuning your receiver.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I see that in this receiver you have separate
controls for the primary and secondary circuits.
To tune in correctly you have to adjust
both circuits to the wave length of the special signal
that you are trying to get.</p>
<p>&#8220;First you start in with a tentative adjustment
of the first primary. Fix it, let us say, for between
a third and a half of its maximum value.
I see that here the coupling between the primary
and secondary is adjustable, so place it at maximum
at the start. Of course you know that maximum
means the position in which the windings
are closest to each other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you fix up the secondary circuit for adjustment
to the wave length, turning it slowly
from minimum to maximum until you come to the
point where the desired station is heard. When
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
this is found, you again readjust the primary until
you find the point of maximum loudness.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you see the advantage of this double control.
If an interfering station butts in, just decrease
the coupling between primary and secondary
and then tune again the two circuits. You
can feel pretty sure of cutting out the interference
and getting clearly just the station that you want.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s mighty good dope,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
had that trouble more than once and haven&#8217;t been
quite clear as to the best way of getting around
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then too,&#8221; went on the radio expert, &#8220;you
must be careful in adjusting the tickler that gives
the regenerative effect. Start in slowly by turning
the control knob toward the maximum.
You&#8217;ll soon strike a point where the signal will
be loud and clear. Now when you&#8217;ve got to that
point, don&#8217;t overdo it. If you get too much regeneration,
the quality of the notes becomes distorted
and before you know it you have only a
jumble. Let well enough alone is a good rule in
tuning, as in many other things. When your
coffee&#8217;s sweet enough, another spoonful of sugar
will only spoil it. Keep to the middle of the
road. It isn&#8217;t the loudest noise you want but the
sweetest music.</p>
<p>&#8220;Be careful, too,&#8221; he urged, &#8220;not to have too
brilliant a filament. It&#8217;s wholly unnecessary to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
have it at a white heat, and you don&#8217;t want to
burn it out any more quickly than you have to.
You can save money in reducing the filament
brightness by increasing the regeneration, which
will make up for the loss of brilliancy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now by keeping these things in mind,&#8221; he
concluded, &#8220;you&#8217;ll be able to operate your set to
the best advantage and get the satisfaction you are
looking for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We certainly hope to, anyway,&#8221; said Bob.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve put a lot of work and quite a little money
into this outfit, and we&#8217;d be mightily disappointed
if we didn&#8217;t get good results.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s not much doubt about that, I think,&#8221;
remarked Frank Brandon. &#8220;You ought to see
some of the sets I come across! They look to be
regular nightmares, but they get passable results,
anyway. Radio is certainly getting to be a country-wide
craze. Only the other day I was at one
of the big broadcasting stations, and the manager
told me that they were actually having trouble to
get performers, there is such a demand for them.
They seem to be especially hard up for novelty
acts&mdash;something out of the ordinary. People get
tired of the same old programmes night after
night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say!&#8221; exclaimed Bob, struck by a sudden
thought. &#8220;Why wouldn&#8217;t that be just the thing
for Larry when he gets a little better? He could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
do his bird imitations just as well as ever, and he
could do it as well sitting in a chair, as far as
that goes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bob, you said something!&#8221; exclaimed Joe,
slapping him on the back. &#8220;That&#8217;s just the kind
of thing that would appeal to people, too. I&#8217;ll
bet he&#8217;d be a hit from the beginning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who is Larry?&#8221; asked Mr. Brandon, curiously.</p>
<p>The excited boys told him all about their acquaintance
with Larry and Tim up to the time of
the almost fatal accident in the theater. Brandon
listened attentively, and when they had finished
sat thinking for several minutes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I think it could be arranged all right,&#8221;
he said at last. &#8220;I know the manager of one big
New Jersey broadcasting station personally, and
I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;d be willing to give your friend a try-out.
If he&#8217;s as good as you say he is, they&#8217;d probably
be glad to put him on the pay roll. From
what you tell me, his act is certainly a novelty,
and that&#8217;s what they want.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>A GLAD ANNOUNCEMENT</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go and see Larry as soon as we get out
of school to-morrow, and see what he says about
it,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;But I guess there&#8217;s no doubt of
what he&#8217;ll want to do. I know he&#8217;s mighty worried
about the future. He told me he didn&#8217;t have
much money saved up, and what he did have must
be about gone by this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You do that,&#8221; agreed Brandon. &#8220;And if he
thinks favorably of the idea, I&#8217;ll find time to go
with him and you to the station I spoke of, and
give him an introduction to the manager and see
that he gets a try-out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s mighty good of you, Mr. Brandon,&#8221;
said Joe. &#8220;Larry is such a fine fellow that when
you get to know him you&#8217;ll feel as interested in
seeing him get along as we are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s likely enough,&#8221; said Brandon. &#8220;Anyway,
if we didn&#8217;t help each other out a little, this
old world wouldn&#8217;t be much of a place to live in.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a little further conversation, Brandon
rose to go. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a pretty busy day ahead of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
me to-morrow, so I think I&#8217;d better turn in rather
early to-night,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Just give me a call at
the hotel any time you want me, or, better yet,
come and pay me a visit in person. You know
you&#8217;ll always be welcome.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet we&#8217;ll come,&#8221; promised Jimmy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jimmy&#8217;s thinking of some special milk chocolate
you gave him once, and is hoping you may
have some more of it,&#8221; laughed Joe.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wasn&#8217;t thinking anything of the kind!&#8221; exclaimed
Jimmy, indignantly. &#8220;What do you
think I am, anyway?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d hate to tell you that,&#8221; said Herb, with a
wicked grin. &#8220;It would hurt your feelings too
much, Doughnuts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I know what chocolate he refers to,&#8221;
said Brandon, laughing. &#8220;And I don&#8217;t wonder
that you remember it, Jimmy. It certainly was
good, but I&#8217;m afraid you won&#8217;t be able to find any
more like it around here. It was sent to me from
Vermont by a married sister of mine who lives
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor old Jimmy!&#8221; exclaimed Bob. &#8220;You&#8217;re
out of luck this time, old timer. If you had only
known that, you wouldn&#8217;t have had to make that
heartbreaking search all over Clintonia.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I didn&#8217;t mind it so much,&#8221; said his good-natured
friend. &#8220;I had a lot of fun sampling all
the different varieties, anyway.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll say you did,&#8221; said Herb. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet you
were glad of an excuse.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t need an excuse,&#8221; retorted Jimmy. &#8220;I
guess there&#8217;s no law against eating chocolate, is
there?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If there were, you&#8217;d be serving a life sentence
now,&#8221; said Joe, heartlessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;From the way you talk, I guess you don&#8217;t like
chocolate, so you won&#8217;t want any of this,&#8221; and
Jimmy proceeded to unwrap a sizable bundle that
he had brought with him, but had forgotten in the
excitement of Brandon&#8217;s visit.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say that, did I?&#8221; asked Joe, in a tone
of injured innocence.</p>
<p>&#8220;No such luck,&#8221; said Jimmy. &#8220;Maybe if you
didn&#8217;t want any, the rest of us might get enough
for once. But I suppose you&#8217;ll want it all, as
usual.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing of the kind,&#8221; denied Joe. &#8220;I&#8217;m perfectly
willing to go on a fifty-fifty basis. Half
for me and half for the rest is all I ask. That&#8217;s
perfectly fair, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fair enough for you, perhaps, but it doesn&#8217;t
make much of a hit with us,&#8221; laughed Bob.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t take any notice of him, Jimmy. Just take
your knife and break that chocolate up into lumps,
and let&#8217;s find out what it tastes like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better wait a few minutes and sample
this, Mr. Brandon,&#8221; said Jimmy, doing as Bob
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
directed. &#8220;I&#8217;ll guarantee that it&#8217;s the best to be
gotten in Clintonia, anyway. I&#8217;ve shopped around
this town looking for your brand of chocolate
until I&#8217;m an expert in that line.&#8221;</p>
<p>The chocolate disappeared as if by magic, and
Frank Brandon rose once more to go.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really going this time,&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;It
won&#8217;t make any difference if you bring out a
dozen packages, Jimmy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I only wish I had &#8217;em to bring out,&#8221; sighed
that individual.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you had, too,&#8221; said Herb. &#8220;Why
didn&#8217;t you get some more while you were about it,
Doughnuts?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You fellows are certainly hard to please,&#8221;
laughed Brandon. &#8220;But I must go now. I hope
you&#8217;ll all drop into the hotel when you get a
chance, and we&#8217;ll smooth out some more radio
kinks. I have some good books in my trunk, too,
that might be of some help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be glad to come,&#8221; said Bob, heartily.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll all drop in some evening around the first
of the week, shan&#8217;t we, fellows?&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, they all agreed to this, and then
Brandon took his leave, accompanied by Joe and
Herb and Jimmy as far as their respective homes.</p>
<p>The next day the radio boys were eager to tell
Larry about the conversation they had had with
Frank Brandon concerning him, and the bright
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
prospects the radio man had held out for his successful
employment. They could hardly wait for
three o&#8217;clock to come, and the bell had hardly rung
when they were all out in the street ready to make
a quick trip to the hospital.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, fellows,&#8221; called Bob. &#8220;They say
that bad news travels fast, but let&#8217;s prove that
good news can hit it up once in a while, too. I&#8217;ll
bet old Larry will be happier this evening than
he has been for a long time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That speed stuff is all right for you fellows,
but don&#8217;t forget that I&#8217;m built more for comfort
than speed,&#8221; grumbled Jimmy. &#8220;Set your own
pace, though, Bob, and I&#8217;ll try to keep up, even if
it kills me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be more apt to do you good,&#8221; said Herb,
as they all set off at a brisk dog trot. &#8220;There&#8217;s
no doubt that you need more exercise than you
get, Doughnuts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I get more than I want already,&#8221; said Jimmy,
who was beginning to puff and pant. The others
had no mercy on him, though, and when at last
they reached the hospital poor Doughnuts was, as
he himself said, &#8220;all in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Larry was glad to see them. He was feeling
rather blue for, in a roundabout way, a report had
reached him that Buck Looker was still connecting
himself and Tim with the loss of the watch
and other things of value at the hotel dance.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
Buck had intimated that the two vaudeville performers
might have passed the stolen things over
to some confederate.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s certainly wonderful to have you fellows
spend so much of your time with a poor old cripple
like me,&#8221; he said, with a smile in which there
was a trace of tears. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;d
ever do if you didn&#8217;t. Tim&#8217;s a good sort about
writing, but I am lonesome and every hour seems
to me like a day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you mean, &#8217;old cripple&#8217;?&#8221; scoffed
Bob. &#8220;Why, the doctor says he&#8217;ll have you out
of here and as good as ever in a little while.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A &#8217;little while&#8217; may mean almost anything,&#8221;
said Larry, with a sad smile. &#8220;But I&#8217;m not kicking,
you understand,&#8221; he added, quickly. &#8220;I know
I&#8217;m mighty lucky to be alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not only alive, but you&#8217;re going to be
mighty busy pretty soon, if you happen to feel
like holding down a good job,&#8221; said Bob.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>FULL OF PROMISE</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean &#8217;good job&#8217;?&#8221; asked Larry,
incredulously, and yet with a note of hope in his
voice. &#8220;You know I can&#8217;t even get around easily
yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but you&#8217;re getting stronger every day,&#8221;
argued Bob. &#8220;In a week or so you won&#8217;t know
yourself. Now, here&#8217;s the proposition we&#8217;ve got
for you,&#8221; and Bob proceeded to outline the plan
that they had worked out the previous evening.
As he proceeded, a light came into the sick boy&#8217;s
eyes that had not been there since the accident,
and a touch of color crept into his cheeks.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say!&#8221; he broke out, when Bob had finished,
&#8220;you fellows are about the best friends that anybody
ever had.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, nonsense!&#8221; exclaimed Bob. &#8220;Why, you
know well enough that you&#8217;d do anything in the
world for one of us if our positions were reversed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it will be simply wonderful for me,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
said Larry. &#8220;Of course, though, I may be counting
the chickens before they are hatched. The
manager of the station may not like my act, you
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s more a question of whether the public will
like it or not,&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;Mr. Brandon seems to
be sure that the manager will give you a try-out,
and I guess they&#8217;ll soon find out whether your act
is popular or not. Judging from the applause you
got in the theater that night, I should certainly
say it was.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I only wish I were strong enough to go right
away,&#8221; said Larry. &#8220;But I guess I won&#8217;t be able
to go this week, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t suppose you would,&#8221; said Bob.
&#8220;But Mr. Brandon is going to make his headquarters
in Clintonia for several weeks, so you don&#8217;t
have to worry about that. As soon as the doctor
says you can make the trip, we&#8217;ll see if we can&#8217;t
borrow or beg an automobile somewhere, and
make the trip to the sending station in style.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that I&#8217;ve got something to look forward
to, I&#8217;ll get well in a hurry,&#8221; Larry assured him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see if you can still make the little birdies
jealous by singing their songs better than they
can,&#8221; suggested Jimmy.</p>
<p>&#8220;You certainly flatter me, but I&#8217;ll do the best
I can,&#8221; laughed Larry. &#8220;What shall it be first?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about the mocking bird?&#8221; suggested
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
Herb. &#8220;I think that&#8217;s one of the prettiest ones,
Larry. I never heard a southern mocking bird,
but if it sounds like that, I&#8217;m going to take a trip
to Dixieland some day just to hear one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never heard one, either,&#8221; confessed Larry,
with a grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t!&#8221; they all exclaimed. &#8220;Where did
you learn it, then?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A professional bird imitator taught me most
of the notes,&#8221; said Larry. &#8220;Of course, I didn&#8217;t
need any lessons to imitate the cute little canary
bird, and the robin&#8217;s notes and a few others I
learned by listening to the birds themselves. I
suppose it would be best to learn them all that way,
if you could, but I never had the time or the
money to go traveling all over the country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;re still waiting for the mocking
bird,&#8221; Herb reminded him. &#8220;I&#8217;ll sing &#8216;Listen to
the Mocking Bird,&#8217; and you come in at the proper
places with the bird effects.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody asked you to sing, did they?&#8221; asked
Jimmy.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, they didn&#8217;t; but I&#8217;m going to sing, anyway,&#8221;
answered Herb, and he started the first bars
of the well known song.</p>
<p>&#8220;We might as well all sing, then,&#8221; said Bob.
&#8220;We can&#8217;t make it any worse than Herb&#8217;s singing,
anyway,&#8221; so they all joined in the song. At the
end of each line they paused, and Larry gave the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
proper bird notes and trills. The result was not
half bad, and before they had finished other convalescent
patients had come into the room and
were listening appreciatively. The boys all had
their backs to the door, and did not know they had
an audience until they came to the end of the
song and there was a round of applause for their
effort.</p>
<p>They all whirled around in some surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t know we were making anybody suffer
but ourselves,&#8221; laughed Bob. &#8220;It must be pretty
hard on you folks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It sounded fine,&#8221; said one. &#8220;We enjoyed it.
Why don&#8217;t you try something else?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t think of it,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;Besides, I
guess that&#8217;s about the only song we all know except
the &#8217;Star Spangled Banner,&#8217; and there aren&#8217;t
any bird songs in that. You give them some more
imitations, though, Larry. You will be all the
better for the practice, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything to oblige,&#8221; grinned Larry, and went
through his whole repertoire, while the little audience
applauded freely.</p>
<p>&#8220;There! that&#8217;s all I know,&#8221; said Larry at last,
when he had imitated every kind of bird he could
think of. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have to get busy and learn some
more, I guess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t know we had such a talented young
man in the place,&#8221; said one elderly gentleman.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to entertain us every day while
you&#8217;re here, young man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if you folks can stand it, I can,&#8221; laughed
Larry. &#8220;I&#8217;ll always be glad to oblige, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>His appreciative listeners thanked him, and
gradually drifted out of the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;You made a hit, Larry,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;It&#8217;s just
as I tell you. Your art is a novelty, and people
are tickled to death with it. You won&#8217;t have to
worry about making good when you get your try-out
at the broadcasting station.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope you&#8217;re right,&#8221; said Larry. &#8220;I can&#8217;t
wait until I&#8217;m strong enough, to take the trip.
Anyway, I&#8217;ll have something to look forward to
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The time had passed so quickly that the boys
could hardly believe it when Bob looked at his
watch and told them it was nearly six o&#8217;clock.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good-night!&#8221; exclaimed Joe. &#8220;We&#8217;ll all be
late for supper now. Guess we&#8217;ll have to say
good-bye and beat it, Larry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose so,&#8221; said Larry, regretfully. &#8220;I
want to thank you all again for what you&#8217;ve done
for me, and believe me, I appreciate it.&#8221;</p>
<p>They all shook hands with him, and then started
for home at a brisk pace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Seems to me we&#8217;re always in a hurry,&#8221; complained
Jimmy. &#8220;You pretty near run my legs
off getting here, and now I&#8217;ve got to repeat the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
performance going home, or else get a cold supper
when I get there. I wonder why I&#8217;m always
out of luck that way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better save your breath, instead of wasting
it in kicking,&#8221; Joe admonished him. &#8220;You&#8217;ll
need it all before you get home, I&#8217;ll tell you. Let&#8217;s
hit it up a little faster, fellows. Jimmy wants to
get home before his supper gets cold, so we&#8217;ll
have to see that he gets there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, Doughnuts, step on the throttle,&#8221;
cried Herb. &#8220;Show us what you really can do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing doing,&#8221; panted Jimmy. &#8220;My throttle&#8217;s
wide open now. You fellows go ahead if
you&#8217;re in such a hurry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess there&#8217;s no such rush as that,&#8221; said Bob,
slowing down to a pace more suited to Jimmy&#8217;s
limited speed. &#8220;Take it easy, old man. We&#8217;re
not going to a fire, after all.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>AN IMPROMPTU FEAST</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Anybody would think we were, to look at us,&#8221;
puffed Jimmy. &#8220;Whew, I&#8217;m all in!&#8221; and he
slowed down to a walk.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;re almost home, anyway,&#8221; said Bob.
&#8220;Take your time, Jimmy. We&#8217;d hate to have you
die of apoplexy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You wouldn&#8217;t hate it nearly as much as I
would,&#8221; said Jimmy, beginning to get his breath
again. &#8220;Just think of what the world would lose
if anything were to happen to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too terrible to think about,&#8221; said Bob, with
mock gravity. &#8220;I suppose the old world would
stop spinning if you should kick the bucket,
Jimmy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe not as bad as that,&#8221; interposed Herb.
&#8220;But a lot of doughnut manufacturers would have
to go out of business, I know that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, you know too much!&#8221; exclaimed Jimmy,
scornfully. &#8220;At least, you think you do, which is
worse. I don&#8217;t see what you have to go to high
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
school for, anyway. You know all there is to
know, already.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know but what you&#8217;re right,&#8221; agreed
Herb, complacently. &#8220;But the trouble is, I can&#8217;t
seem to get the teachers to believe it. Maybe
you&#8217;ll be nice enough to explain things to them
to-morrow, Jimmy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Explain nothing!&#8221; exclaimed Jimmy. &#8220;They&#8217;d
soon think I was as foolish as you, and I&#8217;d hate
to get a rep. like that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Harsh words,&#8221; laughed Bob. &#8220;You fellows
had better quit saying nice things about one another,
or you&#8217;ll be mixing it first thing you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No chance,&#8221; denied Herbert, with a grin.
&#8220;I&#8217;m too hungry to think of scrapping, and I&#8217;ll
bet Jimmy is too. How about it, old pal?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say so!&#8221; agreed Jimmy. &#8220;Thank
heaven we&#8217;re almost home. If we had much further
to go, I guess you&#8217;d have to carry me.&#8221;</p>
<p>They were indeed almost home by this time,
and branched off to their respective houses.
Though they were all late, they managed to make
up for lost time in the way of eating and their
mothers had reason to be thankful that they were
not late very often.</p>
<p>An interesting bit of information came about
this time in the news conveyed by Mr. Rockwell
to Mr. Layton, whom he had chanced to meet on
a train, that the motor boat which had run down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
Larry and his companions had been found in a
remote inlet some distance down the coast, where
it had evidently been deserted by the men who had
stolen it. From sundry papers that had been left
on the boat, through an oversight of the rascals,
it was gathered that they were members of a gang
of hotel thieves who had been &#8220;working&#8221; the hotels
at the summer resorts along the coast, where
a long list of unsolved robberies had been perpetrated.
The police were working on the case,
but the thieves had not yet been apprehended.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Bob, when he heard the news, &#8220;it&#8217;s
good to know that Mr. Wentworth got his motor
boat back anyway. But I won&#8217;t be satisfied till I
hear that the police have landed the thieves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Same here,&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;But it&#8217;s like looking
for a needle in a haystack. They may be out on
the Pacific coast by this time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys worked hard on their big set for the
next few days, spending all the time on it that
they could spare from their studies. They found
time, however, to visit Mr. Brandon, as they had
promised, and had a royal good time in his rooms
at the hotel. They laughed and joked and talked
radio to their hearts&#8217; content. Toward the end
of the evening Mr. Brandon called on Jimmy for
some expert advice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jimmy,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking that a
little&mdash;or rather, a lot&mdash;of ice cream and cake
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
would go well. What is your honest opinion on
the subject?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you could have a much better
idea, no matter how hard you tried,&#8221; said Jimmy,
gravely.</p>
<p>&#8220;Probably not,&#8221; agreed Brandon, with a twinkle
in his eyes. &#8220;Now, as we&#8217;re agreed as to that,
can I call on you for advice and assistance?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You certainly can,&#8221; said Jimmy, slightly mystified,
but ready for anything, nevertheless.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, to come to the point, will you go
out with me and give me the benefit of your expert
advice as to the best place in this neighborhood
to buy the aforementioned ice cream and
cake?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet I will,&#8221; said Jimmy, with alacrity.
&#8220;And without seeming to boast,&#8221; he added, &#8220;you
couldn&#8217;t have picked out any one who knows more
about that particular subject than yours truly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, I suppose I&#8217;ll have to believe you,&#8221;
laughed Frank Brandon. &#8220;I have every confidence
in you, Jimmy.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the event proved, this confidence was not
misplaced. Both the ice cream and cake were
all that heart could wish, and moreover were
served in generous quantities. At the end of the
feast they all expressed themselves as perfectly
satisfied with Jimmy&#8217;s selections, and Bob moved
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
that they give him and Mr. Brandon a vote of
thanks.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Uncle Sam lets me stay in Clintonia long
enough, we&#8217;ll have to have another party like
this,&#8221; said Brandon. &#8220;And maybe by that time
your sick friend will be well enough to come.
I&#8217;d surely be glad to see him, if he can and would
care to. By the way, when will he be well enough
for us to take him to the broadcasting station?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We were out to see him yesterday,&#8221; answered
Bob; &#8220;and it&#8217;s wonderful the improvement he&#8217;s
made since we told him about our plans for him.
He looked a hundred per cent. better, and the doctor
told him he could go Saturday afternoon, if
he kept on making the same progress.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; exclaimed the wireless man. &#8220;I usually
have Saturday afternoons off, and if you boys
want to take him then, it will be all right for me,
unless something very important comes up that I
can&#8217;t sidetrack.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That suits us,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;I spoke to Doctor
Dale about Larry the other day, and he volunteered
to drive us to the station in his car. That
was some offer, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no more than I&#8217;d expect of him,&#8221; said
Brandon. &#8220;Right after we first talked about that
plan I wrote to the manager of the station, Mr.
Allard, and he said to bring your friend along by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
all means. He&#8217;s on the lookout for talent, as I
told you, and will be only too glad to give him a
trial.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds promising,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;What
do you say if we stop at the hospital to-morrow
afternoon, fellows, and tell Larry about it and
find out if he&#8217;ll be strong enough to go?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ll have to count me out,&#8221; said
Jimmy. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got some work I&#8217;ll have to do for
dad, if we&#8217;re going to be away Saturday afternoon.
But you fellows go anyway, and tell him
I was sorry that I couldn&#8217;t get there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll do that then, and count on you sure for
Saturday afternoon,&#8221; said Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, sure thing! I&#8217;ll be with you then,&#8221; promised
Jimmy. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t miss that for a farm.&#8221;</p>
<p>That matter being satisfactorily settled, the
boys said good-night to their host, after assuring
him that they had had a &#8220;bang-up&#8221; time. Their
leave-taking must have wakened any light sleepers
in the hotel, but they got out at last and headed
for home, all of them enthusiastic in praise of
their friend Frank Brandon.</p>
<p>&#8220;I only wish we could have had Larry here to-night,&#8221;
said Joe, regretfully. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet he&#8217;d have
enjoyed it first rate. But I suppose there&#8217;ll be
plenty of other times.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish Mr. Brandon were going to be stationed
in Clintonia all the time,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;He&#8217;s been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
such a good friend to us that I&#8217;ll feel mighty bad
if he has to go away again.&#8221;</p>
<p>They all felt the same way, and said so.</p>
<p>&#8220;But there&#8217;s no use crossing that bridge until
we come to it,&#8221; said Joe, philosophically. &#8220;As
long as he&#8217;s covering this territory, he&#8217;ll make
his headquarters in Clintonia, that&#8217;s pretty
certain.&#8221;</p>
<p>The next day the boys met as they had planned,
immediately after school was out, and headed directly
for the hospital and their convalescent
friend. What with jokes and laughter the distance
seemed short enough. Needless to say,
Larry was overjoyed to see them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly look forward to having you fellows
visit me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You&#8217;re as welcome as letters
from home. I get pretty blue sitting around here
by my lonesome all day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you feel to-day?&#8221; asked Bob. &#8220;Do
you feel well enough to go after a soft job next
Saturday?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I never did feel so sick that I couldn&#8217;t go after
a job that was guaranteed to be soft,&#8221; grinned
Larry.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, then,&#8221; laughed Bob. &#8220;Be ready to
go next Saturday afternoon. We&#8217;ll call for you
in Doctor Dale&#8217;s automobile. He&#8217;s promised to
take the whole bunch of us to the broadcasting
station.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty soft,&#8221; said Larry. &#8220;How do you fellows
come to rate an automobile?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;ve got a big drag around this town,&#8221;
replied Bob. &#8220;I guess they&#8217;d give us the Town
Hall if we asked for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You hate yourselves, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; asked
Larry.</p>
<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t as big a claim as it may seem,&#8221; remarked
Joe. &#8220;The Town Hall is so old that I
think they&#8217;d be glad of an excuse to give it away.
But they won&#8217;t build a new one until the old one
falls down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way with all these bush league
towns,&#8221; remarked Larry, with a wicked grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re getting well all right,&#8221; laughed Bob.
&#8220;When you begin knocking again it&#8217;s a sure sign
that you&#8217;re getting back to form.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet I am,&#8221; returned Larry. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be as
good as ever in a little while. Now that I can
begin to see where the next square meal is coming
from, it gives me some incentive to get well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s fine to hear you say so,&#8221; declared
Bob. &#8220;We&#8217;ll call for you around one o&#8217;clock Saturday,
and we&#8217;ll be at the station about four.
Then if you don&#8217;t convince them that your imitation
of bird songs is better than the little birdies
themselves, we&#8217;ll murder you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I could get in as solid with every audience
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
I play to as I am with you fellows,&#8221; said
Larry. &#8220;Life would be one grand, sweet song.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll get in solid enough to be able to drag
down good pay, don&#8217;t worry about that,&#8221; replied
Joe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll know more about it after Saturday
afternoon,&#8221; said Larry. &#8220;Until then, hope hard.&#8221;</p>
<p>This seemed to sum up the situation fairly well,
and after a little further conversation the radio
boys said good-by to their friend and took their
leave, delighted over his improved condition.</p>
<p>Improved not only in body but in mind. The
pain of his physical hurts had been hard enough
for Larry to bear, but this was little compared to
the mental worry he had been undergoing ever
since the accident had interfered with his money-earning
power and threatened to make him a cripple
for life.</p>
<p>During his brief engagement with the Chasson
show he had loyally sent home to his mother every
dollar he could save from his salary over and
above his necessary expenses, which by rigid
economy he kept as low as possible. But much
of this his mother had been compelled to use to
pay debts incurred during his previous period of
idleness, and he knew that she had very little on
hand. Her enfeebled condition had added to his
anxiety, and he had had many hours of mental
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
anguish as he looked toward the dark and lowering
future.</p>
<p>Now, however, he saw light, and his heart went
out in the warmest gratitude toward the good
friends who had come to his help in his extremity
and made it possible to see a rainbow in the skies
that had been so full of clouds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, if I could only prove that Tim and I
weren&#8217;t guilty of that robbery at the hotel dance,
I would be all right,&#8221; Larry told himself. He
felt sure that the evil-minded Buck Looker was
still holding that happening against him.</p>
<p>The days intervening until Saturday sped
quickly. Dr. Dale was true to the promise he
had made Bob, and was ready with his car when
the radio boys assembled at his house. Since Bob
had told him about Larry&#8217;s unfortunate condition,
the doctor had interested himself in the case
and had been to visit Larry once or twice at the
hospital. He had conceived a liking for the injured
boy, which had made him accede all the
more readily to Bob&#8217;s request for the automobile.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>GETTING A TRIAL</h3>
</div>

<p>Doctor Dale met the boys at the door as they
came up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be ready in a few minutes,&#8221; he told them,
as he admitted them to the parlor. &#8220;Make yourselves
comfortable while I get my hat and coat
on, and we&#8217;ll get started.&#8221;</p>
<p>He left the room, only to reappear a few moments
later in full motoring regalia.</p>
<p>&#8220;All ready,&#8221; he announced. &#8220;Come on out
to the garage and we&#8217;ll get started. Mr. Brandon
called me up this morning, and he&#8217;ll be waiting
for us at his hotel.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys piled into the big seven passenger
touring car and were whisked down to Mr.
Brandon&#8217;s hotel. He was ready and waiting and
jumped into the car almost before it had stopped.
From there they sped quickly to the hospital,
and Bob and Joe helped Larry into the car.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is certainly a wonderful day for me,&#8221;
said Larry. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how I&#8217;ll ever be able
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
to thank you folks for all that you have done for
me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t even try to,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry
about it, and we&#8217;ll agree not to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll let it go at that,&#8221; said Larry.
&#8220;But if I don&#8217;t say any more, you&#8217;ll know I&#8217;m
grateful, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got nothing to be grateful about yet,&#8221;
Joe reminded him. &#8220;They may throw you out,
and that&#8217;s nothing to be thankful for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ouch!&#8221; exclaimed Larry. &#8220;Please don&#8217;t
mention it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t cross that bridge till we come to it,&#8221;
advised Jimmy. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got some chocolate almond
bars that I&#8217;ll guarantee will make you
forget all your troubles while you&#8217;re eating
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Jimmy&#8217;s remedy for all troubles,&#8221; said
Herb. &#8220;Eat and forget them is his motto.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it isn&#8217;t such a bad one,&#8221; remarked Frank
Brandon. &#8220;I&#8217;ve often known my troubles to
look a lot less serious after a square meal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet,&#8221; agreed Jimmy. &#8220;I know I <i>always</i>
feel better myself after a square meal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess we all do,&#8221; said Dr. Dale. &#8220;And
that reminds me that I want you all to come to
my house for supper to-night after we get back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess we&#8217;ll be glad to go all right,&#8221; said
the radio expert. &#8220;But when you see what we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
do to the food, you&#8217;ll probably be sorry you
asked us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take a chance on that,&#8221; laughed Dr. Dale.
&#8220;I generally have a pretty good appetite myself
after a motoring trip, and you young fellows will
have to step some to beat me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll back Jimmy against any entry,&#8221;
grinned Bob. &#8220;We plan to enter him in a pie-eating
contest some day, and when we do we&#8217;ll
bet a lot of money on him to win.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do my best to justify your confidence,&#8221;
retorted Jimmy. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t mind backing myself
with a small piece of change. Pies just seem
to be my natural prey.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait till I get well again,&#8221; said Larry. &#8220;And
you&#8217;ll have some competition from me. It has
always been my highest ambition to be around
some day when a pie wagon gets hit by an automobile.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jerusalem!&#8221; said Jimmy. &#8220;That would be
heaven on earth, wouldn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s probably your idea of it,&#8221; said Joe.
&#8220;I suppose you&#8217;d rather have streets paved with
pie than with gold.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, what&#8217;s the use of talking about it?&#8221;
sighed Jimmy. &#8220;It&#8217;s all too good to be true anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a wonder you fellows wouldn&#8217;t cut out
that talk and look at the landscape a little,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
Bob. &#8220;You&#8217;re missing some pretty fine scenery.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is beautiful,&#8221; remarked Frank Brandon.
&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad we haven&#8217;t got further to go, as
long as Doctor Dale is buying the gasoline.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s cheap at any price,&#8221; laughed Dr. Dale.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what I would ever do without
this car.&#8221;</p>
<p>The miles rolled rapidly behind them, and before
they realized it they were on the outskirts
of New York. The boys thoroughly enjoyed the
ride through the city; probably more than did
Dr. Dale, to whom the heavy traffic was anything
but a pleasure. They finally reached the downtown
ferries, however, and after a slight wait in
line, got on a boat. The boys were absorbed by
the busy scene presented by the river which was
covered with craft of all descriptions. The big
ferryboat edged its way across the river without
mishap and bumped into its slip. The traffic on
the New Jersey side was hardly less dense than
that which they had encountered in New York,
but Dr. Dale skillfully threaded his way through
it and after a drive through narrow streets lined
by foundries and factories, and across the broad
meadows, and past more places of business, they
at last drew up before the big broadcasting
station.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, here we are,&#8221; said Dr. Dale, relaxing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
after the strain of traffic driving. &#8220;How do you
feel, Larry? Strong for anything?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a little shaky, but I guess I&#8217;ll get through
with it all right,&#8221; replied Larry. &#8220;Just lead me
to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys assisted him into the radio station,
where Mr. Brandon introduced them all to the
manager, Mr. Allard.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re just in time,&#8221; said the latter. &#8220;We
need somebody to substitute in our program to-night,
as one of the regular performers is ill.
Come up to the sending room and we&#8217;ll give your
young friend a trial.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go to it, old boy,&#8221; encouraged Bob, in a
whisper. &#8220;Show him what&#8217;s what. Remember
that we&#8217;re all rooting for you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Larry pressed his hand, but had no time to answer
before they were ushered up to the sending
room. One wall of this apartment was covered
with complicated-looking electrical apparatus, a
good deal of which the boys recognized but which
appeared very mysterious to poor Larry.</p>
<p>&#8220;For testing purposes, our apparatus is so
rigged up that we can hear, in this room, exactly
what goes out over the wires,&#8221; the manager explained.
&#8220;If you gentlemen will sit at that table
over there, and all put on headphones, you can
hear your friend&#8217;s performance exactly as it will
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
sound to everybody else who is listening to this
station.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you get that?&#8221; whispered the irrepressible
Herb. &#8220;He called us gentlemen.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up,&#8221; whispered Bob. &#8220;He didn&#8217;t mean
you, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>Following the manager&#8217;s instructions, Larry
took up his position at a short distance from an
instrument called a microphone, and at a signal
from Mr. Allard commenced his bird imitations.</p>
<p>The manager had donned earphones like all the
rest, and the little company listened with varying
emotions as Larry went through his repertoire.
His friends were praying fervently for
his success and were delighted as they realized
that he was surpassing any of his previous efforts.
The manager&#8217;s attitude was critical, but as
Larry went from one imitation to another the
boys could see from the expression of his face
that he was pleased. Larry rose to his opportunity
nobly, and as he realized that he was making
a good impression added trills and notes that
he had never thought of before. By the time he
had finished, all doubt had vanished from Mr.
Allard&#8217;s mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess we can use you all right, young man,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Do you think you can fill in this evening?
I need somebody to round out the bedtime
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
programme at seven o&#8217;clock, and I imagine
your act ought to go well at that time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything you say, sir,&#8221; answered Larry, &#8220;will
suit me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can put you up here for to-night,&#8221; volunteered
Mr. Allard. &#8220;And if you don&#8217;t feel
strong enough to work regularly for a week or
so, you can go back to-morrow and report for
your regular performance a week from to-day.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that would be best,&#8221; put in Frank
Brandon. &#8220;I imagine Mr. Bartlett will need at
least another week before he&#8217;ll be able to work
steadily.&#8221;</p>
<p>Larry was but little older than the radio boys,
and Herb was in an ecstasy of delight over Brandon&#8217;s
&#8220;Mr. Bartlett.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if you stay here to-night you&#8217;ll miss having
dinner at Doctor Dale&#8217;s house!&#8221; cried Jimmy,
impulsively.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess it can&#8217;t be helped,&#8221; said Larry, with a
laugh, in which the others joined. &#8220;Business before
pleasure, you know, Jimmy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what dad always tells me, too,&#8221; grumbled
Jimmy. &#8220;But personally, I&#8217;d rather have
the pleasure first, and let the business take its
chance afterward.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you believe it,&#8221; said Mr. Allard.
&#8220;There are too many people doing that already.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
It&#8217;s a system that will never help you to put
money in the bank, my boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll probably find that out for himself
sooner or later,&#8221; said Mr. Brandon. &#8220;I used to
feel the same way, but I&#8217;ve got over it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll all be sorry that you can&#8217;t be with us
to-night, Larry,&#8221; said Dr. Dale, kindly. &#8220;But
we&#8217;ll be home in time to listen to your first radio
performance this evening, so you&#8217;ll know that
we&#8217;re hearing you just the same as though we
were in this room with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be sure of that, Doctor Dale,&#8221; said Larry.
&#8220;But I know I&#8217;ll be missing a fine supper at your
house, and you know how I&#8217;d like to be there.
I&#8217;ll be back in Clintonia to-morrow, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how are you going to travel back alone?&#8221;
asked Bob. &#8220;You&#8217;re not strong enough to go
sailing around all by your lonesome yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let that worry you,&#8221; replied Mr. Allard.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll see that somebody goes to the train with
him, and I guess one of you fellows won&#8217;t mind
meeting him at the train at the other end.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I rather guess not,&#8221; said Bob, emphatically.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll be there with bells on, Larry; you can
bet on that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems as though I&#8217;m making you all a lot
of trouble,&#8221; said Larry. &#8220;I guess I could get
along all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be there, so there&#8217;s no use of your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
saying any more about it,&#8221; said Bob, in a voice of
finality. &#8220;How about it, fellows?&#8221;</p>
<p>All the radio boys were of the same mind, so
Larry was forced to give in.</p>
<p>&#8220;But if you&#8217;re going to get back to Clintonia
in time to hear my act at seven o&#8217;clock, you&#8217;ll
have to leave pretty soon,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m not
going to detain you here any longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid we will have to be going,&#8221; said Dr.
Dale, glancing at his watch. &#8220;The ferries are
apt to be crowded at this hour, too. But we&#8217;ll
wish you all success at your new venture, Larry.
If you always do as well as you did this afternoon,
you&#8217;ll soon be acquiring a big reputation.&#8221;</p>
<p>They all shook hands with Larry and Mr. Allard,
and went out to where Dr. Dale&#8217;s automobile
was waiting for them.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess Larry was right when he said we&#8217;d
have to make time going back,&#8221; said Mr. Brandon.
&#8220;It&#8217;s three o&#8217;clock now, which doesn&#8217;t leave
us much of a margin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s very true,&#8221; conceded Dr. Dale. &#8220;But
if we can have any luck in getting over the ferry
and through New York traffic, we&#8217;ll make it.
Once out of the city, and I&#8217;ll show you what my
car can do in the way of eating up miles.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>SPEED</h3>
</div>

<p>Fortunately they met with very little delay
in crossing the ferry, and Dr. Dale, in going
through New York, avoided as far as possible
the more congested thoroughfares. In a comparatively
short time they had reached the outskirts,
and Dr. Dale began to speed up a bit. As
they reached the more open country, Dr. Dale
opened the throttle wider, and the big car responded
with a dash and power that delighted
the boys. Mile after mile they reeled off, the
wind whistling in their ears and making conversation
difficult. The boys did not mind this,
however, as they were enjoying the excitement of
speed too much to have any desire to talk.</p>
<p>Slowing down for the towns, but speeding up
again on the open road, the big car put mile after
mile behind it, until the boys began to recognize
the towns they passed through.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say!&#8221; yelled Joe, trying to make himself
heard above the roar of the motor and the whistling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
of the wind, &#8220;aren&#8217;t we making time,
though? At this rate we&#8217;ll get home with time
to spare.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet!&#8221; shouted Bob. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t this a peach
of a ride?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only about six miles more to Clintonia,&#8221;
shouted Frank Brandon, from the front seat
which he shared with Dr. Dale.</p>
<p>Most of that six miles consisted of new concrete
state road as smooth and level as a billiard
table. Up and up crept the speedometer needle,
and the big car seemed to be fairly flying. Fences
and trees flashed past them, and the smooth road
seemed like a river flowing toward them. The
boys were intoxicated with the wild thrill and
exhilaration of speed, and laughed and shouted
and pounded each other on the back. For several
miles the speedometer needle never receded, and
not until the roofs and church steeples of Clintonia
were visible in the distance did Dr. Dale
slacken pace and bring the big machine down to
a sedate twenty-five miles an hour.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, how did you like that?&#8221; he inquired,
turning around for a moment to glance at the
excited boys. &#8220;Was that fast enough to please
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was great!&#8221; declared Bob. &#8220;This car can
certainly step along when you want it to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be at my house in less than ten minutes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
I hope you all feel as though you could eat a
little something.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eat!&#8221; exclaimed Jimmy, in heartfelt tones.
&#8220;Why, I&#8217;m so hungry I&#8217;ve been tempted to start
in and eat the upholstery once or twice.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t,&#8221; laughed Dr. Dale. &#8220;It&#8217;s too
expensive, besides being indigestible. Control
yourself for a few minutes, and I&#8217;ll promise you
something much better than leather to eat.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, then, I&#8217;ll do the best I can,&#8221; promised
Jimmy, with a grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have to pass Antonio&#8217;s shoe repairing
store before we get to Doctor Dale&#8217;s house, and if
you like, I&#8217;ll get out and buy you a nice big chunk
of sole leather, Jimmy,&#8221; suggested Joe. &#8220;If you
really want something along that line, it seems a
shame not to let you have it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks all the same, but I wouldn&#8217;t like to
put you to all that trouble,&#8221; said Jimmy, with
elaborate politeness.</p>
<p>Joe was about to protest that he would not
mind the trouble in the least, but before he had
time to the car drew up in front of Dr. Dale&#8217;s
house.</p>
<p>Mrs. Dale was waiting for them on the front
porch.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was beginning to get worried over you,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;But I suppose you found it quite a
long trip, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t say that it seemed very long to us,&#8221;
replied Mr. Brandon, smiling. &#8220;When you&#8217;re in
a car, you don&#8217;t seem to think of the time much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ve noticed that myself,&#8221; she admitted.
&#8220;But you&#8217;ve arrived in time for supper, and that&#8217;s
the main thing. How did your young friend
make out? Didn&#8217;t you bring him back with
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, they intend to include him in the bedtime
programme for kiddies this evening,&#8221; explained
Brandon. &#8220;It starts at seven o&#8217;clock,
and Larry&#8217;s performance should come in about
half past seven. We&#8217;ll just about have time to
eat before we start listening for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a very few minutes they were all seated
about Dr. Dale&#8217;s hospitable table, and it is hardly
necessary to record the fact that they did full
justice to their hostess&#8217; cooking. As they neared
the end of the meal, Dr. Dale glanced at his
watch.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it is considered very impolite to hurry
one&#8217;s guests,&#8221; he said; &#8220;but just the same, it is
so near now to the time that Larry is scheduled
that I propose that we postpone dessert until after
we have heard him. Then we can take our time,
and do both Larry and the dessert full justice.&#8221;</p>
<p>They all acceded laughingly to this proposition,
and a few minutes later filed into the room where
the doctor kept his radio apparatus. His set was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
equipped with a loud talking device, so that individual
headphones were not necessary.</p>
<p>With a few touches he adjusted his coils and
condensers, and had no difficulty in picking up
the broadcasting station. At the moment some
one was telling a &#8220;bedtime story&#8221; for the little
folks, and, as it happened, this was the last thing
on the programme preceding Larry&#8217;s act.</p>
<p>When the narrator had finished, there came a
short pause, and then the familiar voice of the
announcer.</p>
<p>&#8220;The next number on this programme will be
a novelty, an imitation of various bird calls and
songs, given by Mr. Larry Bartlett.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sonorous voice of the announcer ceased,
and the little group in Dr. Dale&#8217;s house waited
expectantly for the first notes of their friend&#8217;s
performance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hooray!&#8221; shouted Jimmy, as the first notes
of the mocking bird&#8217;s song floated clear and true
from the horn. &#8220;Hooray for Larry, the champion
whistler of the universe!&#8221;</p>
<p>The others laughed at his enthusiasm, but they
were almost as excited themselves. When at
last their friend concluded his performance with
a trill and a flourish, they all gave the three cheers
that Jimmy had suggested, and wished they had
a sending set so that they could congratulate
Larry on the spot.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That surely sounded well,&#8221; said Dr. Dale,
when their delight had somewhat subsided.
&#8220;This may be the beginning of big things for
Larry, because it will not take him long to become
known when he has an audience of somewhere
around a half a million people every evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true enough,&#8221; said Frank Brandon.
&#8220;But it seems hard to realize that science has
really made such a thing possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ready to believe that nothing is impossible
these days,&#8221; said Dr. Dale. &#8220;If I read in
the paper some day that we had got into wireless
communication with Mars, I should believe it
easily enough. In fact, I&#8217;d hardly feel surprised.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure I shouldn&#8217;t,&#8221; agreed the radio expert.
&#8220;A person has to have a receptive mind
to keep up with these quick-moving times.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right,&#8221; agreed Dr. Dale. &#8220;But now,
as we&#8217;ve heard Larry and feel reasonably sure
that his performance has been a success, I propose
that we go back and have our dessert. Does
that meet with your approval, Jimmy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Does it!&#8221; exclaimed Jimmy. &#8220;I should say
so. I never feel as though I&#8217;d really had anything
much to eat unless I have dessert to top
off with.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;After the dinner you ate, I don&#8217;t really
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
believe you could feel hungry, even if you didn&#8217;t
have dessert,&#8221; said Herbert.</p>
<p>&#8220;That must be just one of your phony jokes,&#8221;
said Jimmy. &#8220;You know I was sitting beside
you, Herb, and I felt pretty lucky to get anything
to eat at all. Anybody within three places of you
on each side doesn&#8217;t have much of a show, you
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no use you&#8217;re talking that way,&#8221; said
Herbert. &#8220;Everybody here knows you too well,
Doughnuts. You&#8217;ve got a reputation as an eats
hound that you&#8217;ll never be able to live down.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, I don&#8217;t care,&#8221; said Jimmy, soothed
by the sight of a big apple pie that was on the
table. &#8220;That&#8217;s better than having a reputation
for making punk jokes like yours. If I eat too
much, I&#8217;m the only one that gets a stomach ache
from it, but your jokes give everybody a pain.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>VAULTING AMBITION</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Bang!&#8221; exclaimed Bob, with a laugh.
&#8220;That was saying something, Jimmy. You
surely hit the bull&#8217;s-eye plumb in the center that
time. Guess that will hold you a while, Herb.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a terrible slam,&#8221; acknowledged Herb.
&#8220;If I weren&#8217;t so busy eating this pie, Jimmy, I&#8217;d
be tempted to make you take back those cruel
words.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nary take,&#8221; said Jimmy, positively. &#8220;I said
&#8217;em, and I&#8217;ll stick by &#8217;em. Besides, it&#8217;s so.
Isn&#8217;t it, Bob? I&#8217;ll leave it to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Bob, &#8220;in the interests of truth
I&#8217;ll have to admit that as a rule I&#8217;d rather have
a stomach ache than listen to one of Herb&#8217;s home-made
jokes. But on the other hand, some of
them aren&#8217;t so awfully bad. If you took one
and polished it up a bit here and there and
changed it around a little, it might be good
enough to raise a laugh in an insane asylum.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to me I remember once, a long time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
ago, when he made a joke that was so funny that
we all laughed at it,&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;It hardly seems
possible, but I&#8217;m almost sure I remember it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re all bugs, anyway, so that doesn&#8217;t
prove anything,&#8221; said Herb, calmly finishing the
last of his pie. &#8220;But some day, when I become
a world-famous humorist, you&#8217;ll realize how
dumb you were not to appreciate my jokes.
Now you get them free, but then it will cost you
money to hear them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will never cost me any money,&#8221; said Bob,
with conviction. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t give a plugged
nickel for a book full of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Neither will anybody else,&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;If
you have any idea of ever making a living that
way, Herb, you&#8217;d better forget it. You&#8217;d starve
to death, sure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s a cinch I won&#8217;t have to starve to
death right now, anyway, so quit your croaking,&#8221;
retorted the much abused Herb. &#8220;Whoever told
you fellows that you were judges of humor, anyway?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A person doesn&#8217;t have to be an expert to
judge your jokes,&#8221; came back Joe. &#8220;If he knows
anything at all, he can tell that they&#8217;re rotten.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All your friends seem to have very decided
views on the question, Herbert,&#8221; laughed Frank
Brandon. &#8220;The popular vote seems to be heavily
against you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, their opinions aren&#8217;t worth worrying
about,&#8221; said Herb, complacently. &#8220;As long as
I know my jokes are good, I don&#8217;t care what they
say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the spirit,&#8221; encouraged Brandon.
&#8220;Remember, all great men have had to fight an
uphill battle against criticism.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true,&#8221; said Herb, with a melancholy
sigh. &#8220;And what&#8217;s more, if you can judge by
the amount of criticism, I must be going to be
extra great. Still, that&#8217;s likely enough, I suppose.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t stop him, fellows,&#8221; said Bob, with a
mischievous grin. &#8220;Let him rave on. If he enjoys
kidding himself that way, why should we
wake him up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, you fellows who think you&#8217;re so smart
are probably kidding yourselves,&#8221; said Herb.
&#8220;Nobody could really be as smart as you Indians
think you are and live to tell the story.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one of the failings of human nature
to rate ourselves too highly,&#8221; interposed Dr.
Dale, with a smile. &#8220;But now, how would you
all like to go in and hear the rest of the concert?
We&#8217;ve missed only the first part, and there&#8217;s still
quite a good deal to come.&#8221;</p>
<p>They all acceded to this proposal with alacrity,
and found that, as the doctor had said, they had
not missed much of the programme. The wireless
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
apparatus worked to perfection, and they
could hear everything perfectly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The static isn&#8217;t nearly as bad to-night as it
was a month or two ago,&#8221; said Dr. Dale. &#8220;At
times last summer it interfered a good deal with
my receiving.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s always a good deal worse in summer
than in winter,&#8221; remarked Frank Brandon. &#8220;I
always advise beginners not to start at wireless
in mid-summer, as they sometimes get such poor
results with their small sets that they get discouraged
and give up the game altogether. It&#8217;s
better to wait until fall, and then by the next
summer they&#8217;ve had experience enough to know
how to reduce the bad effects of static.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It used to get pretty bad sometimes at Ocean
Point last summer,&#8221; observed Bob. &#8220;Once or
twice our concerts were almost spoiled by it,
while at other times we&#8217;d hardly notice it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With that set, you ought to be able to get
any broadcasting station in the Eastern States,&#8221;
said Brandon. &#8220;And if you have luck, and conditions
happened to be just right, you might even
get something from the other side, although of
course that isn&#8217;t very likely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;ve been talking about that, but we
don&#8217;t really expect to,&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;We might be
able to get the wireless telegraph signals from
the other side, though, don&#8217;t you think?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s likely enough,&#8221; answered Brandon.
&#8220;The best time to get them is late at night, when
the broadcasting and amateur stations are not
sending. I&#8217;ve often sat and listened with Brandon
Harvey to the big station at Nauen, Germany,
or to the Eiffel Tower in Paris.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jimminy!&#8221; exclaimed Herb. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have to
bone down at our language courses at high
school, fellows. I suppose that they send in
whatever language the people speak where the
sending station is located, don&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As a rule they do, but not always,&#8221; replied
Frank Brandon. &#8220;It depends to a great extent
where the message is being sent to. If it is being
sent to this country, it is often in English,
while if it were being sent to France, it would
be in French, naturally.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose it would have to be that way,&#8221;
said Bob, thoughtfully, &#8220;although I never thought
about that side of it before. It won&#8217;t make much
difference what language they&#8217;re sending in,
though, so long as we know that we can get
their signals. It will be a lot of fun, though,
trying to make out what they&#8217;re saying.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be a good alibi, anyway,&#8221; said Jimmy.
&#8220;If we can&#8217;t understand the dots and dashes, we
can just say that they&#8217;re sending in German or
French or Italian. Nobody could expect us to
know all those languages.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If they did expect it, they&#8217;d be badly disappointed,&#8221;
said Herb. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been wrestling with
French for three terms now, but I don&#8217;t seem to
know much more about it than when I started.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can believe that, all right,&#8221; said Jimmy.
&#8220;Only day before yesterday you flunked your
recitation in French, and the professor told you
that you were forgetting your French faster than
you were learning it. He was right, wasn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll say he was,&#8221; said Herb, shamelessly. &#8220;At
the rate I&#8217;m learning it, it would be strange if I
weren&#8217;t forgetting it faster. I&#8217;ll have to do a
lot of cramming to pass the mid-term exams.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You fellows had better quit your talking and
listen to the music,&#8221; suggested Joe. &#8220;Here&#8217;s a
swell quartette that has just been announced.
Can the chatter and do a little listening.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s easy,&#8221; said Herb. &#8220;I&#8217;d rather hear a
good quartette than almost anything else I
know of.&#8221;</p>
<p>For another hour or so they listened to the
concert, which turned out to be an unusually fine
one. Then, when the last selection had been
given, Mr. Brandon rose to go.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had a wonderful afternoon and evening,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;and I&#8217;ve enjoyed every minute of it.
I hope the next time you give a party like this,
Doctor Dale, that I&#8217;ll be invited again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You surely will,&#8221; replied the doctor, heartily.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
&#8220;The latch string always hangs outside the door
for you, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>The radio boys also expressed their appreciation
of the entertainment they had received, and
Doctor Dale invited them cordially to come again.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to be at the station to-morrow to meet
Larry,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But as to-morrow is Sunday,
I shall be unable to get there. But don&#8217;t forget
to give him my congratulations on his success,
will you?&#8221;</p>
<p>This the boys promised to do, and then they
and Mr. Brandon said good-night and started
homeward.</p>
<p>&#8220;My, but this has been a full day,&#8221; said Bob.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve certainly been moving some since this
morning. And think of all we&#8217;ve accomplished.
I&#8217;ll bet Larry will get well so fast now that he&#8217;ll
surprise the whole lot of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet Tim will be glad to hear about it,&#8217;&#8221;
remarked Joe. &#8220;I wonder if he&#8217;s got an engagement
yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He hadn&#8217;t, up to a few days ago,&#8221; said Bob.
&#8220;Larry told me that in one of the letters he had
received from him he said he had several prospects,
but nothing definite. You know, of course,
that Chasson wouldn&#8217;t keep Tim after Larry&#8217;s
accident broke up the act.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Larry told me about that,&#8221; replied Joe.
&#8220;I guess poor Tim has had pretty hard sledding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
lately, too. But he has his health, and I guess
he&#8217;ll land an engagement soon, if he hasn&#8217;t already
got one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s too clever a dancer to be out of work
very long, it seems to me,&#8221; said Herb. &#8220;If I
were manager of a show, you can bet I&#8217;d snap
him up pretty quick.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; agreed Jimmy. &#8220;He&#8217;s certainly
a crackerjack dancer, but there is one thing
about him that I never thought much of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; asked Bob, curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, haven&#8217;t you ever noticed what a light
appetite he has?&#8221; asked Jimmy. &#8220;I&#8217;d be ashamed
of myself if I couldn&#8217;t eat more than he does.
He&#8217;s always through a meal before I&#8217;ve fairly
got started.&#8221;</p>
<p>Frank Brandon laughed at this and interrupted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Guess I&#8217;ll have to say good-night, fellows,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Here&#8217;s my hotel, and I, for one, feel
tired enough to sleep. I&#8217;ll try to be at the station
to-morrow to meet Larry, but I won&#8217;t promise.
I&#8217;m expecting instructions from the government
that may change my plans at any time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t expect to have to leave Clintonia
soon, do you?&#8221; asked Bob, anxiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I hardly think so. Not right away, anyway,&#8221;
answered the wireless man. &#8220;I may have
to be away a few days, but I&#8217;ll be back again
soon.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re all hoping that you&#8217;ll be stationed here
permanently,&#8221; said Bob, as all paused in front
of Mr. Brandon&#8217;s hotel. &#8220;We&#8217;d hate to see you
transferred away from here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s mighty nice to hear,&#8221; said the radio
expert, and his tone left no doubt that he was in
earnest. &#8220;You may believe that I&#8217;ll do my best
to stay here, anyway. This is the center of a
pretty large territory, and the wireless business is
growing so fast that it&#8217;s possible I&#8217;ll be able to.
We&#8217;ll make the most of the time I&#8217;m here,
anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet we will,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be looking
for you at the station to-morrow, anyway,
but if you&#8217;re not there we&#8217;ll tell Larry why you
couldn&#8217;t come.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys said good-night to Frank Brandon,
and started on the short walk to Main Street and
their homes.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>NEW HOPE</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I told Larry to come on the twelve-fifty
train to-morrow,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;We can get together
when we come out of church, and we&#8217;ll
have plenty of time then to walk to the station.
We don&#8217;t want to take any chances of Larry&#8217;s
getting in without any one to meet him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not on your life,&#8221; agreed Joe, emphatically.
&#8220;But how are we going to get him to the hotel,
Bob? I know we can&#8217;t get dad&#8217;s car. He&#8217;s too
awfully busy just now. It isn&#8217;t much of a walk
from the station, but it&#8217;s too far for Larry just
yet, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s all chip in and hire a taxi,&#8221; proposed
Bob. &#8220;It won&#8217;t cost us much, and I guess we
can all squeeze into one easily enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m game,&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;I can hang onto the
spare tire if there isn&#8217;t room enough inside.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess that won&#8217;t be necessary,&#8221; laughed Bob.
&#8220;Of course, Jimmy takes up a little extra room,
but then Herb brings it back to average again.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></p>
<p>It was agreed that they should hire a taxicab
according to Bob&#8217;s suggestion, and then the boys
said &#8220;so-long&#8221; and dispersed to their homes.</p>
<p>The following day they met at the church door,
as they had agreed, and walked rapidly down to
the station. It was a glorious day, with just a
hint of frost in the air, and all the boys were in
high spirits. They found it hard to remember
that it was Sunday and that they must act accordingly,
but managed to get to the station
with a due amount of decorum.</p>
<p>The train was a few minutes late, but the time
did not seem long to them. They hired a taxicab
in advance, and by the time that transaction
was finished they could see the train in the distance.
As it drew into the station, they eagerly
scanned the alighting passengers. Larry was
one of the last to alight, and the boys were almost
beginning to fear that he was not on the
train when they spied him on the last car. With
one accord they rushed in that direction, and in
a few seconds Larry found himself on the platform,
with the boys bombarding him with questions
and congratulations.</p>
<p>&#8220;How did it seem to be performing for the
benefit of about half a million people at one
time?&#8221; inquired Joe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not very different from performing for only
a few,&#8221; laughed Larry. &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t worrying
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
much about the half million. What was bothering
me was to please just one&mdash;Mr. Allard.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose that&#8217;s about the size of it,&#8221; agreed
Bob, as they started toward the taxicab. &#8220;I
guess he was satisfied, though, wasn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he didn&#8217;t say much directly, but he took
me on permanently, and is going to pay me almost
twice as much as Chasson did; so I guess
that&#8217;s a pretty good indication that he likes the
act,&#8221; replied Larry. &#8220;But where are you Indians
taking me to, anyway?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask questions, but just come along,&#8221;
said Bob. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got a taxi waiting here, and
Mr. Brandon has hired a room for you at his
hotel, so you see you&#8217;ve got nothing to worry
about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly looks that way,&#8221; agreed Larry.
&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m in the hands of my friends. I&#8217;ll be
good and do as I&#8217;m told.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better, until you get your strength
back,&#8221; threatened Bob. &#8220;We can lick you easily
now, you know, so you&#8217;d better speak nicely to
us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, when people treat me to a ride in a
taxicab, I speak nicely to them anyway, so that
they&#8217;ll be encouraged to do it again,&#8221; said Larry.
&#8220;So, you see, I have a double incentive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better make the most of this ride,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
laughed Joe. &#8220;When you begin to get your pay
checks, we&#8217;ll expect you to hire the taxicabs,
shan&#8217;t we, fellows?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet we will,&#8221; said Jimmy. &#8220;This is the
life! Taxicabs must have been made especially
for me, I like to ride in them so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too bad Tim can&#8217;t be with us now,&#8221; said
Bob. &#8220;Have you heard how he is getting along
lately, Larry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that reminds me!&#8221; exclaimed Larry.
&#8220;You can bet your bottom dollar I&#8217;ve heard from
him lately. Not an hour after I had gone through
my act last night I got a telegram from him congratulating
me. It seems that he was listening
in at a radio set somewhere, and I guess it must
have pretty nearly knocked him off his pins when
he heard the announcer give my name. As soon
as I finished he must have rushed out and sent
the telegram. Here it is, and you can read it
for yourselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>He fished through his pockets, and at last produced
the crumpled slip of yellow paper.</p>
<p>Bob took it up and read aloud.</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;Fine work, old man. Keep it up. Have got
engagement, too. More by letter. Tim.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<p>&#8220;Good for him!&#8221; exclaimed Bob. &#8220;We were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
speaking about him last night, and wondering
how he was making out. I&#8217;m mighty glad to hear
that he has landed an engagement.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So am I,&#8221; said Larry. &#8220;Although, now that
I&#8217;ve got one, he would have had half of what I
made until he did drop into something. It&#8217;s always
been share and share alike with us.&#8221;</p>
<p>By this time the taxicab had reached the hotel,
and the boys helped Larry out. He was regaining
his strength rapidly now, and his friends were
delighted to note the improvement in him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t need that crutch much longer,
Larry, I can see that,&#8221; Bob told him.</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope not,&#8221; responded Larry. &#8220;And won&#8217;t it
be a happy day when I can throw it into the discard?
Believe me, it&#8217;s a terrible thing to have to
rely on one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope we never have to make the experiment,&#8221;
said Bob, soberly. &#8220;But you&#8217;re mighty
lucky to be getting along the way you are. When
they first took you to the hospital, the doctor
didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d pull through. He didn&#8217;t say so
in so many words, but we could see that he
thought it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t doubt it,&#8221; said Larry, as they slowly
mounted the steps leading to the lobby. &#8220;You
can believe that I felt as though the roof had
caved in on top of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>At that moment a tall boy passed them rapidly,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
going out of the door into the street. It was
Buck Looker, and he had passed the others without
recognizing them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever hear any more from Buck?&#8221;
questioned Bob of Larry.</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; and Larry&#8217;s face clouded. &#8220;But I suppose
he still thinks me guilty of that robbery.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Forget Buck!&#8221; cried Joe. &#8220;He isn&#8217;t worth
worrying about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps not. Just the same, I wish that matter
was cleared up. I hate to have a cloud over
my name,&#8221; answered Larry seriously.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>LISTENING IN</h3>
</div>

<p>Larry registered at the desk, and then they
were whisked up in the elevator to the lad&#8217;s room.
Bob had inquired at the desk for Frank Brandon,
but was informed that he had left early that
morning and had left word for the boys that he
would not be back in Clintonia before the following
evening.</p>
<p>Larry&#8217;s room was only two removed from that
of the radio expert, and was fairly large and comfortably
furnished. The young actor was delighted
when he saw it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, this is great!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;This has
got the hospital beat a thousand ways. If the
eats are only as good as the room, I&#8217;ll be in
clover.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t find anything the matter with the
eats,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;This hotel has a reputation
for setting a good table, and I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll
have any fault to find with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When I get my first pay check, we&#8217;ll try it out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span>
together,&#8221; promised Larry. &#8220;You&#8217;ll all be my
guests, for a change, and we&#8217;ll make the chef step
around a bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hooray!&#8221; crowed Jimmy, &#8220;that&#8217;s the kind of
talk I like to hear, Larry. It certainly sounds like
sweet music to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is rather pleasant,&#8221; added Bob. &#8220;All you&#8217;ve
got to do is set a date, Larry, and we&#8217;ll be there
with nickel-plated appetites and cast iron digestions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You fellows haven&#8217;t said much about your
radio lately. How is it coming along? I&#8217;m afraid
you&#8217;ve spent so much time on me lately, that
you&#8217;ve gotten behind on that new set you were
telling me about.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, that&#8217;s coming along all right,&#8221; said Bob.
&#8220;We haven&#8217;t set any hard and fast date to have it
finished, you know. We&#8217;ve all had to bone down
pretty hard at school this term, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Could you hear me plainly last evening?&#8221;
inquired Larry.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;d been sitting in the room with us, it
couldn&#8217;t have sounded any different,&#8221; Joe assured
him. &#8220;Doctor Dale has a good set for shorter
ranges, but except under very favorable conditions
he can&#8217;t get the distant stations, like Detroit,
for instance.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you expect to be able to hear Detroit?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll be able to hear any station in the Eastern
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
States,&#8221; Bob informed him. &#8220;This is going
to be a set that is a set, Larry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, so much the better,&#8221; said Larry. &#8220;If
you can hear as far as that, you won&#8217;t have to
live in fear of not hearing my performance only
a few miles away. I know it would break your
hearts if you couldn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It makes me sad just to think of such a terrible
thing,&#8221; sighed Herb. &#8220;Wait till I get my handkerchief,
fellows, and mop up the flowing tears.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw, chase yourself,&#8221; grinned Larry. &#8220;The
only thing that would bother you radio bugs if
you didn&#8217;t hear me, would be the fear that your
blamed old set wasn&#8217;t working just right. You&#8217;d
be down under the table fussing around with a
few thousand wires, but you&#8217;d never stop to think
that maybe I&#8217;d been fired by the manager, or run
over by a trolley car.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, we&#8217;d never have to worry about you,&#8221;
said Joe. &#8220;You&#8217;ve heard the old saying that &#8216;only
the good die young.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly have,&#8221; admitted Larry. &#8220;And that
probably explains why that stage scenery didn&#8217;t
kill me outright. It&#8217;s been rather a mystery to
me why it didn&#8217;t, but you&#8217;ve put me wise to the
real reason.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It will do for want of a better one, anyway,&#8217;&#8221;
laughed Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we can once get you interested in radio,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
Larry, you&#8217;ll be as stuck on it as any of us,&#8221; said
Joe. &#8220;It&#8217;s interesting right from the beginning,
but when you dig into it a bit, it gets more fascinating
all the time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m interested in radio all right, don&#8217;t
male any mistake about that,&#8221; returned Larry,
with a twinkle in his eye. &#8220;It&#8217;s my meal ticket
now, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but I mean in the way of recreation,&#8221;
persisted Joe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I suppose it must be mighty interesting,
for a fact,&#8221; admitted Larry, more seriously.
&#8220;Just wait until I get strong again, and maybe I&#8217;ll
take it up in earnest. I&#8217;ve seen enough of it to
realize that there are wonderful possibilities in
it, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll be glad to initiate you any time you
say the word,&#8221; offered Bob. &#8220;We don&#8217;t know
enough about it to keep us awake at night, but we
can probably explain a few things to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;ll ask questions until you wish you&#8217;d
never mentioned radio to me,&#8221; laughed Larry.
&#8220;If I do take it up, I&#8217;ll have to start at the beginning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s where most everybody starts,&#8221; announced
Jimmy. &#8220;You won&#8217;t be a bit worse off
than we were, will he, fellows?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say not,&#8221; answered Bob. &#8220;When we
started, we hardly knew the difference between an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
antenna and a ground wire. We had our own
troubles at first; and we&#8217;re still having them, as
far as that goes. There always seems to be something
new coming up that you have to work out.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I keep on getting good pay from the broadcasting
station, I&#8217;ll be able to buy a set, anyway,&#8221;
said Larry. &#8220;What&#8217;s the use of working so hard
over one, when you can buy them all made up?
All you have to do is hook them up to a small
antenna, and you get your music right off the
bat.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the radio boys all scouted this idea.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you can buy one all made up,&#8221; said
Bob. &#8220;But there&#8217;s not half the fun in operating
that kind of set as there is in one that you&#8217;ve made
yourself. And besides, you can get a lot better
results when you&#8217;ve made the thing yourself and
understand just what&#8217;s in it and how it works. If
you don&#8217;t get good results some evening, you
know where to look for the trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like driving an automobile when you don&#8217;t
understand the mechanism,&#8221; added Joe. &#8220;As long
as everything goes all right you go sailing along,
but let something go wrong, and you&#8217;re up a tree
right away. You haven&#8217;t any idea of where to
look for the trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, all right,&#8221; laughed Larry. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
shoot, and I&#8217;ll promise never to mention it again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;See that you keep it, then,&#8221; said Bob, laughing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
&#8220;But anybody who buys a made-up set isn&#8217;t
entitled to be called a real radio fan; at least, we
don&#8217;t think so.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you&#8217;re right,&#8221; agreed Larry. &#8220;It
must be half the fun of the game when you do
the job yourself. But remember that everybody
can&#8217;t build elaborate sets the way you fellows do,
even if they want to. They haven&#8217;t got the
knack.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose that&#8217;s so,&#8221; conceded Bob. &#8220;But almost
anybody that can drive a nail straight can
do it. It&#8217;s mostly a matter of hard work and a
little study.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, when I get a little stronger, maybe I&#8217;ll
take a fling at it,&#8221; said Larry. &#8220;But just at present,
the only thing I can think about is getting
something to eat. I had a pretty early breakfast,
and now I&#8217;m rather anxious to try some of that
good cooking you tell me this hotel is famous
for.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My!&#8221; exclaimed Bob, jumping to his feet.
&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you mentioned dinner, Larry. I&#8217;ll have
to take it on the run if I&#8217;m going to get home in
time for dinner. They&#8217;re always sore if I&#8217;m late,
too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And to think that I overlooked such an important
thing as Sunday dinner!&#8221; ejaculated
Jimmy, searching frantically around for his cap.
&#8220;I only hope I can last out until I get home,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
he went on. &#8220;If I do, it will only be on account
of my strong will power. I&#8217;m afraid poor old
Herb hasn&#8217;t much chance to pull through.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; snorted Herb. &#8220;If you had to depend
on will power to get you home, you&#8217;d never get a
block away from here. You&#8217;ll get home all right,
but the thing that gets you there will be the
thought of how good the chicken and apple pie are
going to taste.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, nobody could have a stronger motive
than that, after all,&#8221; said Jimmy. &#8220;Confound this
elevator, anyway. I guess it&#8217;s never going to
come up. You fellows can wait if you want to,
but I&#8217;m going to walk down. I know I&#8217;ll get
there, then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Doughnuts does have a good idea once in a
while,&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;I&#8217;ll do the same thing.&#8221; The
others were nothing loath, so they shook hands
with Larry and clattered down the long flights of
stairs at high speed, for, as Bob said, it would
never do to let the elevator beat them down after
all.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>THE WONDERFUL SCIENCE</h3>
</div>

<p>The boys arrived at the street floor breathless
but triumphant, and started in the direction of
home at so brisk a pace that poor Jimmy had some
difficulty in keeping up. He was in as much of a
hurry as any of the others, however, and by great
effort managed to keep up with his companions.</p>
<p>&#8220;After this, we all should be eligible to go in a
walking race,&#8221; laughed Bob, as they paused a minute
at his door. &#8220;Can you all get around this
evening and listen to some radio? I&#8217;ve got to get
out some lessons this afternoon, and I guess you
have, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say so!&#8221; exclaimed Joe. &#8220;You know
how much chance we had to do them yesterday,
and I&#8217;ve got a good three hours&#8217; work ahead of
me. I guess I can get around this evening all
right, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>Herb and Jimmy both said that they would be
on hand, and then they went on, separating as
each reached his own home.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span></p>
<p>Shortly after supper that evening they all met
at the Layton home according to appointment.
As it was Sunday, they did not do any work on
their new set, but the whole Layton family gathered
around the loud speaker that evening, as a
prominent preacher was to deliver a sermon by
radio, and they were all eager to hear it.</p>
<p>Before the sermon there was an organ recital,
and they heard this perfectly, after the boys had
succeeded in tuning out one or two amateurs who
sometimes made them trouble. Of course, everybody
enjoyed the recital, and also the sermon,
which was delivered in very effective style.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is certainly being up to date,&#8221; commented
Mr. Layton, when the sermon was over. &#8220;When
I was the same age as you boys, I was expected
to be in church every Sunday evening without
fail. But now it does not seem quite so necessary,
when it is possible to have religious services right
in the home, as we have had them this evening.
I think the Layton family is indebted to you boys,
as the chances are neither Mrs. Layton nor I
would ever have become interested in it if Bob
and you hadn&#8217;t introduced us to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet you never thought much of it when we
first started to build an amateur set, now did you,
Dad?&#8221; accused Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;As I don&#8217;t see any way out of it, I suppose
I&#8217;ll have to confess that you&#8217;re right,&#8221; laughed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
Mr. Layton. &#8220;But you must remember that you
boys were among the first to take up wireless in
Clintonia, and at that time nobody in town had
thought anything about it. I guess we didn&#8217;t
realize its possibilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a surprise to me when that first set that
you boys made really worked,&#8221; admitted Mrs.
Layton. &#8220;I remember that it sounded very nice
right from the start, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that was a good old set,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;It
didn&#8217;t satisfy us for long, though. It was all right
under favorable conditions, but you couldn&#8217;t do
much tuning with it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not only that, but the range was pretty limited,
too,&#8221; chimed in Joe. &#8220;When I think of all
the planning we had to do before we got it made,
I feel like laughing.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was no laughing matter then, though,&#8221; said
Herb. &#8220;If it hadn&#8217;t worked, we&#8217;d have been a
pretty disappointed crowd.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never forget the sensation when that first
music came in over our set,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;It was
certainly a grand and glorious feeling. I only
hope our new set comes up to scratch as well as
that one did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess there isn&#8217;t much doubt about the new
set,&#8221; observed Joe, confidently. &#8220;It will just <i>have</i>
to work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look out,&#8221; laughed Mr. Layton. &#8220;Don&#8217;t forget
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
the old saying, that &#8216;pride goeth before a
fall.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we may have an awful bump coming to
us, I suppose,&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;But we&#8217;d be awfully
sore if it didn&#8217;t work, after all the labor we&#8217;ve
put on it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll make it work, all right,&#8221; predicted Bob.
&#8220;Maybe not on the very first trial, but we&#8217;ll get
it going in the end, I&#8217;ll bet a cookie.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I surely hope it will be all right, because I
know how bad you would all feel if it didn&#8217;t,&#8221;
said Mrs. Layton. &#8220;I never knew boys would
work so hard at anything, just for the sake of the
fun they expect to get out of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They may get a good deal more than just fun
out of it,&#8221; remarked Mr. Layton, seriously. &#8220;It
looks to me as though radiophony were only just
starting at present, and it seems certain that it
offers a big field for any one who has the desire
and ability to take up that line of work. It may
turn out to be a fine thing for them later on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose that&#8217;s very true,&#8221; said his wife,
thoughtfully. &#8220;Although that side of it never occurred
to me before.&#8221;</p>
<p>After a little further conversation, Joe, Herb,
and Jimmy said good-night and took their leave,
thinking, as they walked home, of what Mr. Layton
had said. They had all entertained the same
idea before, but his words had encouraged them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
Why not? Surely there must be many openings
in so large a field for bright and ambitious young
fellows, and in their dreams that night the boys
had visions of fame and fortune attained through
the medium of wireless telephony.</p>
<p>They were discussing this the next afternoon
on their way home from school, when their speculations
were brought to an abrupt end by the sight
of Larry hobbling down the street toward them as
fast as he could travel with his crutch, his face
flushed and his free arm wildly waving.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>THE VANISHING CROOKS</h3>
</div>

<p>The radio boys broke into a run, and soon
reached their excited friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Larry?&#8221; asked Bob. &#8220;You
look as though you had just seen a ghost. What&#8217;s
the trouble?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish you&#8217;d gotten here a few minutes
sooner!&#8221; panted Larry. &#8220;Confound this blamed
crutch of mine. How can anybody hope to make
any speed with one of these things?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He can&#8217;t,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;But hurry up and tell
us what&#8217;s eating you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I just saw the fellows that were in that motor
boat when it ran us down!&#8221; exclaimed Larry.</p>
<p>&#8220;You did?&#8221; cried the radio boys in chorus.
&#8220;Did you try to stop them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I did,&#8221; replied Larry. &#8220;But they
evidently recognized me, for they gave me one
look, and then started off at top speed. I tried to
run after them, but I&#8217;m too blamed crippled yet
to do much speeding, and of course they got away
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
clean. If you fellows had come along three minutes
sooner, we could have caught them, I think.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They can&#8217;t have got very far yet, then,&#8221; said
Bob. &#8220;Which way did they go? It may not be
too late to catch them even now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They went around that corner,&#8221; answered
Larry, pointing with his crutch. &#8220;I got there as
soon as I could, but by the time I arrived there
was no sign of them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid we haven&#8217;t much chance to catch
them now, but we might as well try, anyway,&#8221;
said Bob. &#8220;Judging from the direction they took,
it looks as though they might have headed for the
station. Suppose we each take a different street,
and work down to the station, keeping our eyes
open as we go along? Even if we don&#8217;t succeed
in catching them, we may find somebody who
knows them and can give us some information.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sounds good to me,&#8221; agreed Joe, briefly, and
the others also assented to Bob&#8217;s plan.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go straight down High Street, then,&#8221; said
Bob, decisively. &#8220;You take Jerome Avenue, Joe.
You take Van Ness Avenue, Herb. And you take
Southern Boulevard, Jimmy. They all run together
near the station, and we can meet there.
So-long, Larry. Whether we learn anything or
not, we&#8217;ll come back to the hotel and let you know
all about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, then, I&#8217;ll be waiting for you,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
Larry, with a wave of his hand. &#8220;I only wish
that I could help you, but I&#8217;m a lame horse yet.
Good luck, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>The radio boys set out at top speed, each one
hunting high and low along the street assigned to
him, and asking questions of every one he met.
But the strangers seemed to have vanished into
thin air, for, hunt as they would, the boys could
find no trace of them. At the railroad station
they learned that a train had left for New York
only a few minutes before, but the ticket agent
said he did not remember selling tickets to any
men such as the boys described.</p>
<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t prove anything, though,&#8221; he said,
as he noted their disappointment. &#8220;I sell so many
tickets here during the day that I don&#8217;t notice who
buys them much. The only time I&#8217;d be likely to
notice anything would be if the parties were excited
or nervous, and I don&#8217;t remember anything
like that this afternoon.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys thanked him, and left the station.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s too bad,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;I would have
given a lot to have caught those fellows for Larry.
People that are mean and selfish enough to upset
a boat and then not even try to rescue the people
in it, ought to get what&#8217;s coming to them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d certainly have enjoyed taking a swift
punch or two at them myself,&#8221; agreed Joe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if we didn&#8217;t catch them, it wasn&#8217;t for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
lack of trying,&#8221; said Herb. &#8220;People looked at me
as though they thought I was crazy when I asked
them questions about the fellows we were after.
I didn&#8217;t even know enough about them to describe
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My idea was that they&#8217;d probably keep on running
even after they&#8217;d gotten away from Larry,
and in that case somebody would have been sure
to notice them,&#8221; explained Bob. &#8220;It looks as
though they were wise enough to slow down as
soon as they thought they were safely away,
though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No use crying over spilt milk,&#8221; said Jimmy
philosophically. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go back to Larry and report
&#8216;nothing doing.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose that&#8217;s about all we can do,&#8221; agreed
Bob. &#8220;We&#8217;ll keep a sharp lookout on the way
back, and we may find something, after all.&#8221;</p>
<p>But this hope was doomed to disappointment.
There was no sign of the rascals they sought, and
there was no help for it but to tell Larry of their
lack of success.</p>
<p>The latter was naturally greatly disappointed,
but he put a cheerful face on the matter.</p>
<p>&#8220;When they once got away from me, I gave up
hope of catching them, for this time, anyway,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;Clintonia is getting to be such a big town
that it&#8217;s easy for people to lose themselves in it.
The only thing to do is hope for better luck next
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
time. I&#8217;m mighty grateful to you fellows for trying
so hard to find them, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t thank us for doing nothing,&#8221; said Bob,
a little ruefully. &#8220;If we had caught those rascals,
it would have been different.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it was just hard luck that you fellows
didn&#8217;t come along a few minutes sooner. We&#8217;d
have got them then, sure. But I&#8217;ve got a hunch
that we&#8217;ll run across them again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet you traveled faster with that stick of
yours than you ever thought you could, didn&#8217;t
you?&#8221; asked Herb, with a grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I did,&#8221; laughed Larry. &#8220;I must have
looked funny hopping along there. But it won&#8217;t
be long now before I&#8217;ll be traveling around on my
own two feet again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re certainly looking better every time I
see you,&#8221; remarked Bob. &#8220;I guess you&#8217;ll be plenty
strong enough to start in at steady work at
the broadcasting station next week, won&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, sure,&#8221; responded Larry. &#8220;I could do it
this week, as far as that goes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get too ambitious,&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;A week&#8217;s
rest here will do you all kinds of good.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you find the grub as good as we told you it
would be?&#8221; asked Jimmy.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s simply heavenly,&#8221; said Larry, solemnly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Say!&#8221; exclaimed Bob, suddenly, &#8220;have any of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
you Indians happened to think what next Monday
is?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said Herb, flippantly. &#8220;It&#8217;s the day
after next Sunday. Ask me something harder
next time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; said Bob, giving him a withering
glance. &#8220;As our friend Herbert says, it is the
day after Sunday, but it also happens to be Columbus
Day, and therefore a holiday. How did
we ever come to forget that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hooray!&#8221; they shouted, and with one accord
linked arms and executed an impromptu dance.</p>
<p>&#8220;That being so, let&#8217;s go with Larry when he
reports for work,&#8221; proposed Joe. &#8220;Who&#8217;s game
to do it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m with you!&#8221; exclaimed Bob. &#8220;We can see
that Larry gets there all right, and maybe Mr.
Allard will show us over the station. We were
in such a hurry when we were there before that
we couldn&#8217;t see very much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to go first rate,&#8221; said Herb. &#8220;But I&#8217;m
so far behind on my French that I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ll
have to stay at home and make up for lost time.
I&#8217;m &#8217;way back in math., too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t be able to go either, I&#8217;m afraid,&#8221; said
Jimmy, dolefully. &#8220;Dad has just taken a big contract,
and I&#8217;ve promised to help him all my spare
time next week. I&#8217;d forgotten about Monday being
a holiday, though,&#8221; he added, truthfully.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if you can&#8217;t, that&#8217;s all there is to it,&#8221;
said Bob. &#8220;Maybe you&#8217;ll change your minds before
then, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to come just on my account,
fellows,&#8221; said Larry. &#8220;Of course, I&#8217;d love to have
you come, but I don&#8217;t want you to think you&#8217;ve
got to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t that at all,&#8221; Bob assured him. &#8220;In the
first place, it will be fun to take the trip, and then,
if we get a chance to look around the station, we
may get some good tips for our new set.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Larry, doubtfully, &#8220;since you put
it that way, it will be great to have you come with
me. I guess I&#8217;ve got influence enough around
there already to show you the inside works.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, then, we&#8217;ll consider that settled,&#8221;
said Bob. &#8220;Joe and I will call for you early in
the afternoon. By that time Mr. Brandon will
be back, and maybe he&#8217;ll come, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>The radio inspector returned the next day, but
he could not promise to accompany the little party,
as he had to attend a meeting at headquarters the
following Monday.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>BROADCASTING MARVELS</h3>
</div>

<p>The remainder of the week sped quickly by,
and almost before the boys realized it the holiday
had arrived. Larry spent the morning at Bob&#8217;s
house, where he watched Bob and Joe working on
the new set, and kept his promise to ask questions.</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t do me much good, though,&#8221; he said,
fairly puzzled at last. &#8220;That&#8217;s about the most
mysterious looking box of tricks that I&#8217;ve ever
had the hard luck to look at. What are all those
dials and knobs for? Do you keep your money in
there, or what?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You must think they are combination locks,&#8221;
laughed Bob. &#8220;This knob here controls a condenser,
and this one a transformer.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But how do you know what to do with them?&#8221;
asked the bewildered Larry. &#8220;How do you know
which one to turn and which one to leave alone?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t,&#8221; laughed Bob. &#8220;You may have an
idea about where they should be placed, but it&#8217;s
different every evening.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and during the evening, too,&#8221; added Joe.
&#8220;You have to keep adjusting all the time to get
the best results.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if it depended on me, I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;d
only get the worst results,&#8221; said Larry. &#8220;It all
looks terribly complicated to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to worry much about it, anyway,&#8221;
said Joe. &#8220;All you have to do is whistle
into the transmitter, and it&#8217;s up to us to hear you.
We have to do all the work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lucky thing for me that it is that way,&#8221;
said Larry. &#8220;If I had to learn all about radio before
I could give my act, I&#8217;d probably starve to
death first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Radio is just like everything else,&#8221; said Bob.
&#8220;It looks very mysterious and difficult to an outsider,
but when you get into it a little way and
understand the rudiments, it begins to look a lot
simpler. It wouldn&#8217;t take you very long to catch
on to it. Especially a smart lad like you,&#8221; he
added, with a grin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cut out the comedy,&#8221; said Larry. &#8220;Any time
I get a compliment from you or Joe, I know
there&#8217;s a nigger in the woodpile somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The trouble with you is, you&#8217;re too modest,&#8221;
said Joe. &#8220;When we do say something good
about you, you think we&#8217;re only kidding.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think&mdash;I know,&#8221; replied Larry, grinning.
&#8220;I suppose, though, that radio must be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
pretty easy, or you fellows wouldn&#8217;t know so
much about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That remark has all the appearance of a dirty
dig,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;But I suppose we can&#8217;t land on
him until he gets entirely well, can we, Joe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, let him live a little while longer,&#8221; replied
his friend. &#8220;We&#8217;ll get even for that knock,
though, Larry, my boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t lie awake at night worrying about it,
anyway,&#8221; replied Larry. &#8220;But I&#8217;m not going to
interfere with your work any more. Just go
ahead as though I weren&#8217;t here, and I&#8217;ll try to
learn something by watching what you do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob and Joe worked steadily then until Mrs.
Layton called to them to come up to lunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Toot! toot!&#8221; went Larry, imitating faithfully
a factory whistle blowing for twelve o&#8217;clock.
&#8220;Time to knock off, you laborers. If you work
any longer I won&#8217;t let you belong to the union any
more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No danger of that,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been
feeling hungry ever since ten o&#8217;clock, so I&#8217;m not
going to lose any time now. Come on up and
we&#8217;ll see what mother&#8217;s got for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>They found a lunch waiting for them that
would have made a dyspeptic hungry, and they
attacked it in a workmanlike manner that drew
an approving comment from Mrs. Layton.</p>
<p>&#8220;I declare it&#8217;s some satisfaction to get a meal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
for you boys,&#8221; she declared. &#8220;You certainly eat
as though you enjoyed it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no camouflage about that, Mother; we
<i>do</i> enjoy it,&#8221; answered Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wouldn&#8217;t be human if we didn&#8217;t enjoy it,
that&#8217;s fairly certain,&#8221; said Larry. &#8220;The meals at
the hotel are pretty good, but they&#8217;re not in the
same class with this lunch at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know they have a reputation for setting a
good table there,&#8221; said Mrs. Layton. &#8220;I hope you
fare as well in the city. You&#8217;ll board there, I suppose,
won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I expect to,&#8221; said Larry. &#8220;Mr. Allard,
the manager, recommended me to a good place
near the station, and I guess they won&#8217;t let me
starve to death there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let us hope not,&#8221; smiled Mrs. Layton. &#8220;Any
time you are in Clintonia, we&#8217;d be very glad to
have you visit us, you know. I suppose Bob has
told you that, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I certainly did!&#8221; exclaimed her son. &#8220;I have
a hunch that after eating a while in boarding
houses a good home-cooked meal must be a welcome
change.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll say it is,&#8221; assented Larry. &#8220;But there are
one or two good restaurants fairly near the station,
anyway, so in case I get tired of the food at
the boarding house, I can switch to a restaurant
for a while.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That sounds like jumping from the frying pan
into the fire,&#8221; grinned Joe.</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose it is something along that line,&#8221; assented
Larry, with a rueful laugh. &#8220;But what is
a poor fellow to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose it can&#8217;t be helped,&#8221; assented Bob, as
he finished his dessert. &#8220;But now, fellows, there
doesn&#8217;t seem to be anything more to eat, so I guess
we&#8217;d better be moving if we&#8217;re going to catch the
two o&#8217;clock train.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That shows you how much gratitude I can expect
from him,&#8221; said Mrs. Layton, laughingly appealing
to the others. &#8220;&#8216;Eat and run&#8217; seems to be
his motto these days.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s always so much to be done, it
would keep anybody on the jump,&#8221; protested Bob.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t seem to be fading away under the strain,
though, do I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. And while your appetite continues the
way it is, I guess I shan&#8217;t need to worry about
you,&#8221; replied Mrs. Layton.</p>
<p>Larry and Joe said good-by to their hostess,
and then all three boys started for the station.
They had good fortune in catching the trolley that
ran to the railroad station, and just had time to
get their tickets before the train pulled in.</p>
<p>It was more than a two-hours&#8217; run to the point
where they must change cars, but it seemed to
them that they had hardly gotten settled in their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
seats before it was time to get off. Larry told
them many comical stories of his experiences
while traveling from town to town and funny
incidents that had occurred at rehearsals and during
performances.</p>
<p>&#8220;You get pretty tired of traveling all the time,
though,&#8221; Larry remarked at length. &#8220;This engagement
you fellows and Mr. Brandon have
gotten for me is certainly a relief. I&#8217;d be mighty
glad to have it, even if I hadn&#8217;t been hurt. I&#8217;ve
had enough of jumping around all over the country
to suit me for a while.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet it does get mighty tiresome,&#8221; assented
Bob, as the boys rose to get out. &#8220;But here we
are, and as the train doesn&#8217;t go any further, I
suppose we might as well get off.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t a bad idea,&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;I suppose
there&#8217;s no use trying to persuade the conductor to
go on a little further.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t imagine you&#8217;d better even think of it,&#8221;
said Larry. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a hunch that he&#8217;d only get
peeved if you did.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then, I&#8217;ll take your advice,&#8221; grinned Joe.</p>
<p>As they emerged from the terminal into the
street at their final destination, Joe asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;But how are we going to find this place,
Larry? Do you know the way?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but I know how to find somebody who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
does,&#8221; replied Larry, and he signaled to a taxicab
driver.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nix, Larry, nix!&#8221; expostulated Bob. &#8220;We
can get there on the trolleys. You&#8217;d better save
your cash.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You fellows blew me to a taxi ride when I
landed in Clintonia the last time, so I&#8217;m going to
do the same for you,&#8221; said Larry, obstinately.
&#8220;No use in kicking now, so just forget it.&#8221;</p>
<p>During this brief dialogue the taxi had approached
them, and now stopped as the driver
swung open the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hop in, fellows,&#8221; directed Larry, and then he
gave the driver directions to drive to the big
broadcasting station.</p>
<p>With a jerk and a rattle they were off, and
there ensued an exciting ten minutes as the taxicab
scooted through the traffic, shooting across streets,
and missing collisions by the narrowest of margins
a dozen times in the course of the brief journey.
The boys held on tight to prevent being
thrown from their seats, and they all heaved sighs
of relief when at length the vehicle came to a
sudden halt in front of the big broadcasting
station.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; exclaimed Bob. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what
this will cost you, Larry, but whatever it is, you
get your money&#8217;s worth of excitement, anyway.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
Taking a ride in one of those things is like going
out to commit suicide.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s nothin&#8217;,&#8221; grinned the driver, who had
overheard this remark. &#8220;We was takin&#8217; it easy all
de way. If you guys had been in a hurry, now, I
might have shown you a little speed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you did pretty well, as it was,&#8221; said Bob.
&#8220;You were in a hurry, if we weren&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Larry paid the man, and he was off at top speed
and had disappeared around a corner before Larry
had fairly put his change away.</p>
<p>&#8220;That must be a great life, driving a taxi all
day in a big city,&#8221; said Larry. &#8220;But let&#8217;s go in,
and see if we can find the boss. I hope he&#8217;ll act
tip nice and show you fellows the whole works.
I&#8217;ll go around with you and try to look wise, but
I won&#8217;t have any idea of what it&#8217;s all about.&#8221;</p>
<p>Entering the office, they had little difficulty in
seeing the manager, and he readily consented to
have the boys look over the station, turning them
over to an assistant, as he was too busy to take
them around himself.</p>
<p>Mr. Reed, the assistant, did not appear particularly
pleased with his assignment at first, but
when he found that the boys were well grounded
in radio, his attitude changed.</p>
<p>&#8220;I get tired of showing people around who don&#8217;t
know a thing about radio, and do nothing but ask
fool questions,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;But when I get
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
some one who knows the subject and can understand
what I&#8217;m showing him, that&#8217;s a different
matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>He showed them over the sending station from
the studio to the roof. The boys listened with the
keenest interest as he described to them the methods
by which the broadcasting was carried on,
which every night delighted hundreds of thousands
of people within range of the station.</p>
<p>In a little room close to the roof they saw the
sending apparatus which really did the work.
There was a series of five vacuum bulbs through
which the current passed, receiving a vastly
greater amplification from each, until from the
final one it climbed into the antenna and was
flung into space. To the casual onlooker they
would have seemed like simply so many ordinary
electric bulbs arranged in a row and glowing
with, perhaps, unusual brilliance.</p>
<p>But the boys knew that they were vastly more
than this. Where the electric light tube would
have contained only the filament, these tubes at
which they were looking contained also a plate
and a grid&mdash;the latter being that magical invention
which had worked a complete revolution in
the science of radio and had made broadcasting
possible. From the heated filament electrons were
shot off in a stream toward the plate, and by the
wonder-working intervention of the grid were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
amplified immeasurably in power and then passed on
to the other tube, which in turn passed it on to a
third, and so on until the sound that had started
as the ordinary tone of a human voice had been
magnified many thousands of times. This little
series of tubes was able to make the crawl of a
fly sound like the tread of an elephant and there
is no doubt that a time will come when
through this agency the drop of a pin in New
York City can be heard in San Francisco.</p>
<p>The boys were so fascinated with the possibilities
contained in the apparatus that it was only
with reluctance that they left the roof and went
to the studio. This they found to be a long,
rather narrow room, wholly without windows, and
with the floors covered with the heaviest of rugs.
The reason for this, as their guide explained, was
to shut out all possible sound except that which
it was desired to transmit over the radio.</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the idea of having no windows?&#8221;
asked Bob.</p>
<p>&#8220;So there shall be no vibration from the window
panes,&#8221; replied Mr. Reed. &#8220;I tell you, boys,
this broadcasting hasn&#8217;t been a matter of days,
but is the development of months of the hardest
kind of work and experiment. We have had to
test, reject, and sift all possible suggestions in
order to reach perfection. I don&#8217;t mean by that
to say that we have reached it yet, but we&#8217;re on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
the way. New problems are coming up all the
time, and we are kept busy trying to solve them.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems a simple thing,&#8221; he went on, &#8220;to talk
or sing into that microphone,&#8221; pointing to a little
disk-like instrument about the height of a man&#8217;s
head. &#8220;But even there the least miscalculation
may wholly spoil the effect of the speech or the
music. Now, in a theater, the actor is at least
twenty feet or so from the nearest of his audience
and the sounds that he makes in drawing in his
breath are not perceptible. If he stayed too close
to the microphone, however, that drawing in of
breath, or some other little peculiarity of his delivery,
would be so plainly heard that it would
interfere with the effect of his performance. So,
with certain instruments. A flute, for instance,
has no mechanical stops, so a flute player can
stand comparatively near the microphone. The
player of a cornet, however, must stand some distance
back or else the clicking of the stops of his
instrument will interfere with his music. These
are only a few of the difficulties that we meet and
have to guard against. There are dozens of
others that require just as much vigilance to
guard against in order to get a perfect performance.
It&#8217;s a pleasure to explain these things to
you, boys, for you catch on quickly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re a long way from being experts,&#8221; said
Bob, &#8220;but we&#8217;ve done quite a good deal of radio
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
work and built several sets of our own, so we can
at least ask intelligent questions.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, fire away, and I&#8217;ll try to answer them,&#8221;
replied Mr. Reed. &#8220;You may be able to stick me,
though.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said this as a joke, but before they had completed
a tour of the building the boys had asked
him some posers that he was at a loss to answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;I almost think you fellows should be taking
me around,&#8221; he said at last. &#8220;Blamed if I don&#8217;t
think you know as much as I do about it.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>THE FIRST VENTURE</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re regular sharks, those boys,&#8221; said
Larry, who was thoroughly enjoying Mr. Reed&#8217;s
discomfiture. &#8220;I think they&#8217;d be able to stick Mr.
Edison, I&#8217;ll be blest if I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense,&#8221; laughed Bob. &#8220;We&#8217;re only asking
about things we don&#8217;t understand ourselves. You
know the did saying, &#8216;a fool can ask more questions
than a wise man can answer.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, there, speak for yourself!&#8221; exclaimed
Joe. &#8220;You may be a fool, but don&#8217;t class me under
that heading.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I was only speaking figuratively, as the profs
say,&#8221; laughed Bob. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to take me
too literally, of course.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All I&#8217;ve got to say is, that you&#8217;re both pretty
well up on radio,&#8221; said Mr. Reed. &#8220;Are you a
shark too, Larry?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not I,&#8221; answered Larry. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been trying to
learn something about it since I met Bob and Joe
here, but I can&#8217;t say that I&#8217;ve made much progress.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
Besides, you can&#8217;t do much learning in a hospital,&#8221;
he added, with a rueful laugh.</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t what you would call an ideal place,&#8221;
admitted Mr. Reed. &#8220;But now that you&#8217;re working
here, you ought to pick it up pretty soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to make a real try at it now,&#8221; promised
Larry. &#8220;It&#8217;s a shame to be so ignorant about
the business that&#8217;s giving you a living.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but I don&#8217;t see where our knowledge of
radio is bringing us much cash,&#8221; said Joe.</p>
<p>&#8220;How about that hundred and fifty dollars we
won between us in prizes?&#8221; Bob reminded him.
&#8220;That was quite a little cash, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a long time ago, though,&#8221; returned Joe.
&#8220;I wish I knew some way to pick up a little extra
change now. Christmas is not very far off, and
heaven knows how I&#8217;m going to buy anybody any
present.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you do anything in the way of a song or
a recitation?&#8221; asked Mr. Reed. &#8220;I know Mr.
Allard needs one or two short bits to fill out the
programme to-night, but I don&#8217;t suppose you
could do anything of that sort, could you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid not,&#8221; replied Joe. &#8220;I know two or
three recitations that I learned for the elocution
class, but I&#8217;m afraid that&#8217;s about the full extent
of my entertaining power. If I tried to sing,
folks would think that some accident had happened
to their apparatus.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></p>
<p>&#8220;A good recitation or two might be just what
the boss is looking for,&#8221; returned Mr. Reed. &#8220;It
Couldn&#8217;t do any harm to ask him about it, anyway.
What is your specialty, Layton?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no such thing,&#8221; laughed Bob. &#8220;As an
entertainer, I&#8217;d be a terrible frost.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure of that,&#8221; said the other. &#8220;Suppose
we look up Mr. Allard, anyway, and see
what he has to say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try anything once,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;I suppose
it can&#8217;t do any harm to try, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you can get away with it, why not pick up
a few dollars?&#8221; asked Larry. &#8220;It isn&#8217;t like facing
a big audience, you know. The audience is
there, all right, but you don&#8217;t see them, and
it&#8217;s easier to forget about them than in a
theater.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t try it for a farm in a theater,&#8221; said
Joe. &#8220;But I guess I could work up nerve enough
to talk into that sending apparatus. It won&#8217;t be
as bad as reciting in the auditorium at high school,
at any rate.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bank too much on it,&#8221; warned their conductor.
&#8220;Mr. Allard may not think well of the
plan, or he may have found some one else by this
time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be satisfied either way,&#8221; said Bob, philosophically.
&#8220;I&#8217;d like to make a little money, all
right; but, on the other hand, I&#8217;m beginning to get
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
stage fright already. If Mr. Allard turns us
down it will be a relief, after all.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the manager, when interviewed, seemed relieved
at the prospect of having their services.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I can use you both very nicely this
evening,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Of course, I&#8217;ll have to hear
your stuff before I can tell. Suppose you let us
hear one or two of your recitations, Mr. Atwood.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; grinned Joe. &#8220;You&#8217;ll probably
give me the hook before I get through, though;
but you can&#8217;t say I didn&#8217;t warn you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll take a chance,&#8221; smiled the manager.
&#8220;Do your worst.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus exhorted, Joe recited a humorous piece he
had learned recently for delivery in the elocution
class, and he recited it very well, too. When he
had finished Mr. Allard called for more, and Joe
obliged with the only other selection in his repertoire.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s first rate,&#8221; said the manager, when he
had finished. &#8220;I think that ought to go all right.
I think I&#8217;ll give you ten or fifteen minutes on the
bill. Now, how about you, Mr. Layton? What&#8217;s
your specialty?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t own such a thing,&#8221; grinned Bob. &#8220;I
know one piece that I learned for elocution, the
same as Joe, but you wouldn&#8217;t want two of the
same variety on the bill.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, that&#8217;s true,&#8221; agreed Mr. Allard. &#8220;Let&#8217;s
see, now,&#8221; and he thought a minute or two.</p>
<p>&#8220;How would this do?&#8221; he exclaimed at length.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve got all sorts of books here with jokes and
riddles in them. Suppose we pick out a few good
conundrums, and you can learn them and the answers
between now and seven o&#8217;clock. Then,
right at the beginning of the bedtime stuff, you
give the riddles, and we&#8217;ll announce that the answers
aren&#8217;t to be given until the very end of the
performance. That will keep them guessing all
through it, and keep them interested. Then at
the end you can give the answers. How does that
strike you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m game,&#8221; replied Bob, grinning. &#8220;I guess
if I bone down to it I can learn a few by then.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t even have to memorize them, if
you don&#8217;t want to,&#8221; said Mr. Allard. &#8220;You can
read them right off if you&#8217;d rather. Your audience
won&#8217;t be able to see what you&#8217;re doing,
you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That would probably be better,&#8221; agreed Bob.
&#8220;Then there won&#8217;t be any chance of my forgetting
the answers. Think of how tough it would
be on the kids if I gave them a riddle and then
forgot the answer. That would be a terrible
trick to play on them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you can suit yourself about that,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
returned Mr. Allard. &#8220;It&#8217;s almost six o&#8217;clock now,
so perhaps you&#8217;d better go out and get a bite to
eat right now. I&#8217;ll pick out a few good conundrums,
and you&#8217;d better get back as soon as you
can and study them up a bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;We&#8217;ll make it snappy.&#8221;</p>
<p>He and Joe and Larry went out and had a quick
meal at the nearest restaurant.</p>
<p>&#8220;You fellows have broken into the entertaining
game with your usual speed,&#8221; remarked Larry.
&#8220;Who would have imagined this morning that
you would be on the broadcasting programme this
evening?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We wouldn&#8217;t have been, one time out of a
hundred,&#8221; answered Bob. &#8220;If one of the regulars
hadn&#8217;t been sick, we never would have gotten a
look in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;It&#8217;s an ill wind that blows nobody any
good,&#8217;&#8221; quoted Joe. &#8220;We&#8217;ll make our car fare
out of this, and something over. It&#8217;s lucky I
happened to speak as I did to Mr. Reed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But say!&#8221; exclaimed Bob, struck by a sudden
thought. &#8220;Won&#8217;t Jimmy and Herb be knocked
silly when they hear our voices this evening?
They won&#8217;t be able to believe their ears.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You said it,&#8221; declared Joe. &#8220;But the worst of
it is, we won&#8217;t be there to see their faces at the
time. I&#8217;d give the evening&#8217;s profits to see them
then.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It will be a scream, all right,&#8221; agreed Larry,
with a chuckle. &#8220;You two will have it all over
all the other radio fans in Clintonia when you get
back. They&#8217;ll be green with envy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess it will make them sit up and take notice,&#8221;
assented Bob. &#8220;Just make out Lon Beardsley
won&#8217;t be sore. This will be a terrible blow
to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good thing it isn&#8217;t the other way
around,&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;If it were Lon who was on
the broadcasting programme, we&#8217;d never hear the
last of it. You&#8217;d be hearing about it ten years
from now.&#8221;</p>
<p>The three friends finished their meal and returned
to the broadcasting station, where Mr.
Allard was waiting for Bob with the riddles that
he had selected.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here are a few funny ones,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You
can practice up on the delivery of them, and Larry
will give you some pointers about the best way to
say them. I don&#8217;t imagine you&#8217;ll have any trouble
when the time comes.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>WINNING OUT</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;It seems to me he takes a lot for granted,&#8221;
said Bob, after the manager had left the room.
&#8220;How does he know that both of us won&#8217;t get
rattled right in the middle of the thing and ball
up the whole programme?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess it&#8217;s because he&#8217;s heard something about
both you and Joe from Mr. Brandon, and he&#8217;s
pretty sure you&#8217;ll come up to the scratch,&#8221; said
Larry. &#8220;That&#8217;s the way I figure it out, anyway.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll do the best we can to live up to
our reputation, if that&#8217;s the case,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
read these things aloud the way I think they
should go, Larry, and you correct me if I&#8217;m
wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go ahead,&#8221; replied Larry. &#8220;You&#8217;ve been telling
me so much about radio that I ought to be
willing to tell you something about how to put a
joke over.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bob settled down to his task in earnest then,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
and for an hour rehearsed the jokes with Larry,
who drilled him in the most effective way to tell
them to advantage.</p>
<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; exclaimed Larry, at the end of that
time. &#8220;I think you ought to get by all right now,
Bob. You&#8217;re doing fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if they don&#8217;t like me, I can&#8217;t help it,&#8221;
said Bob. &#8220;At any rate, they won&#8217;t be able to
throw any dead cats at me. That&#8217;s one big advantage
that radio entertainers have.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true enough,&#8221; laughed Larry, &#8220;although
I hadn&#8217;t thought about it before. Maybe
I&#8217;d have had a poor pussy cat wrapped about my
neck before this if I&#8217;d been doing my act in a regular
theater.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nonsense!&#8221; replied Bob. &#8220;Nobody threw anything
at you when you were acting in a regular
theater, did he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; admitted Larry. &#8220;That is, nothing except
big bunches of American Beauty roses,&#8221; he
hastily added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, of course, that&#8217;s understood,&#8221; gibed Joe.
&#8220;I suppose you had to hire a big truck every evening
to cart them away.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, every evening,&#8221; grinned Larry. &#8220;And
the applause&mdash;&mdash;good gracious! The people for
blocks around used to complain about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t get much applause now,&#8221; laughed
Bob. &#8220;How does it seem to perform for the benefit
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
of a telephone transmitter instead of an audience?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It never bothered me much,&#8221; replied Larry.
&#8220;It seems to be pretty hard for some of the actors,
though, especially the comedians. When they
spring a funny joke they&#8217;re used to hearing their
audience laugh, and when they don&#8217;t hear anything,
they get peeved sometimes. They can&#8217;t get
used to the blank silence after their best
efforts.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can easily understand how it would have that
effect,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;It might save them a lot of
trouble, though. Take the case of a black-face
artist. He wouldn&#8217;t need to put on any make-up
at all, if he didn&#8217;t want to.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if they don&#8217;t, they don&#8217;t feel natural, and
it&#8217;s apt to spoil their act. An actor is pretty temperamental,
you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m beginning to feel that way myself,&#8221;
sighed Joe. &#8220;I wish it were time for us to spring
our stuff on an unsuspecting public and get it
over with. It must be pretty near time for the
first number now, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It sure is,&#8221; answered Larry. &#8220;We&#8217;d better go
on up to the transmitting room. The worst crime
a public performer can commit is to be late, you
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And to think that I&#8217;m the poor fellow that&#8217;s
supposed to open the show!&#8221; exclaimed Bob.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></p>
<p>&#8220;My, I&#8217;ll be as glad to get it over with as you
will, Joe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s saying a mouthful,&#8221; replied his friend.
&#8220;Oh, what a relief it will be!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If the audience can stand it, you two ought to
be able to,&#8221; said Larry, cruelly. &#8220;Quit your worrying.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess if the audience can stand you, it won&#8217;t
mind us,&#8221; returned Bob, giving Larry a friendly
poke in the ribs. &#8220;Guess that will hold you a
little while, old timer.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before Larry could think of a suitable retort
they had entered the transmitting room, and he
had to postpone his reply for the time being.</p>
<p>Mr. Allard was already there.</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you feel?&#8221; he asked them, in greeting.
&#8220;Probably a trifle nervous?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a little bit,&#8221; Bob admitted. &#8220;I think we&#8217;ll
make out all right, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; replied the manager. &#8220;Don&#8217;t get rattled,
and you&#8217;ll go over all right. From what Mr.
Brandon has told me, you don&#8217;t either of you rattle
easily, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re ready any time you are, sir,&#8221; was Bob&#8217;s
comment.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right, then,&#8221; said Mr. Allard, crisply.
&#8220;It&#8217;s time now, Morton,&#8221; addressing the announcer.
&#8220;You can go ahead and announce Layton&#8217;s
act.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span></p>
<p>This the announcer did, and then, tense with
excitement but thoroughly master of himself, Bob
stepped to the transmitter and propounded the
first of his conundrums. With book in hand,
Larry stood at his elbow to prompt him in case
he forgot anything, but his friendly services were
not needed. Bob went through the whole list
without a mistake and with no fumbling, speaking
clearly and distinctly into the transmitter.
Although he could not see his audience, he nevertheless
sensed the listening thousands, and felt the
lift and exhilaration that come to the successful
entertainer. His part in the programme was
short, a scant ten minutes, but he enjoyed every
minute of it.</p>
<p>When he had asked the last riddle, he stepped
back, and mopped big drops of perspiration from
his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad that&#8217;s over,
although it wasn&#8217;t as bad as I thought it would
be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to go all through it again when
you give the answers,&#8221; Larry reminded him,
cruelly.</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess I can stand it,&#8221; said Bob. &#8220;Did I do
it all right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure you did,&#8221; they all assured him. &#8220;It was
good work.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a little while the time came for Joe to give
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
his recitations, and he, too, did good work. It
was easy to see that the manager was pleased with
both of them, and, indeed, he did not hesitate to
say so.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you fellows didn&#8217;t live so far away, I&#8217;d be
glad to make you a regular part of the programme,&#8221;
he told them later. &#8220;You both have a
good delivery, and I can see that Brandon was
right when he said you didn&#8217;t lack nerve. It&#8217;s
too bad you don&#8217;t live in this town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we could do much along that
line just now, anyway,&#8221; said Bob, much pleased.
&#8220;Between high school and building radio sets we
don&#8217;t have much time left over. We appreciate
your giving us a chance on the bill to-night,
though. We never dreamed of such a thing when
we left the house this morning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t wait to get back to Clintonia to see
what Herb and Jimmy have to say,&#8221; remarked
Joe. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet their eyes are sticking out now
like a crab&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boys then said good-night to Mr. Allard
and Larry, and took a somewhat hurried departure,
as they had very little time left in which
to make the last train for Clintonia.</p>
<p>Meantime, Herb and Jimmy had been treated
to the surprise of their lives. Shortly after supper
Jimmy had whistled the familiar call in front
of Herb&#8217;s house, and when his friend had emerged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
had invited him to come to his house that evening.</p>
<p>&#8220;You know I&#8217;ve got my set rigged up now,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;the one that I entered for the Ferberton
prize. It didn&#8217;t win the prize, but it&#8217;s a pretty
good set all the same. There&#8217;s a good radio programme
on for this evening, and I suppose you
want to hear it as much as I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I certainly do,&#8221; answered Herb. &#8220;Besides,
if we hear Larry, we&#8217;ll know that the three
of them arrived at the other end on time. It will
be almost as good as having them right here with
us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Get your coat on, then, and we&#8217;ll be going,&#8221;
said Jimmy. &#8220;It&#8217;s not so far from seven o&#8217;clock,
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Herb ran back into the house, and, emerging
shortly afterward, joined his friend, and they set
out for Jimmy&#8217;s house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Conditions ought to be ideal for radio to-night,&#8221;
Herb remarked, as they walked along.
&#8220;It&#8217;s clear as a bell. There won&#8217;t be enough static
to-night to bother any one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So much the better,&#8221; said Jimmy. &#8220;That set
of mine doesn&#8217;t get very good results when the
static is bad. I thought it was the real thing once,
but compared with the sets we&#8217;ve made since, I
can see where it might be a lot better.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, there aren&#8217;t many things that are so
good that they can&#8217;t be improved,&#8221; remarked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
Herb. &#8220;I suppose even if I set out to make a
perfect set, I might fall a little short of the mark
somewhere.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That seems almost impossible, but of course
you ought to know,&#8221; replied Jimmy, with a grin,</p>
<p>&#8220;I only wish we had our set finished that we&#8217;re
working on now,&#8221; said Herb. &#8220;Then we ought to
get real results.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t take us so very long now,&#8221; returned
Jimmy. &#8220;Most of the hard work is done, and all
we have to do now is to assemble it, I guess we
can get busy at that pretty soon now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The sooner the better,&#8221; answered Herb. &#8220;It
seems to me that we&#8217;ve been at it an awfully long
while.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so long when you consider all the work
that there is to a set like that,&#8221; said Jimmy. &#8220;But
here we are, and I&#8217;m beginning to feel hungry
again, although it isn&#8217;t very long since I had supper.
I think I&#8217;ll hunt around in the kitchen and
see if I can&#8217;t find a few doughnuts. I&#8217;m pretty
sure that there are some left in the crock.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how there can be, if you knew
they were there,&#8221; laughed Herb. &#8220;But I hope
you do find some. Your mother&#8217;s doughnuts have
a reputation, you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go up to my room first, and then I&#8217;ll
have a look,&#8221; said Jimmy.</p>
<p>Herb had hardly gotten his coat off before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
Jimmy returned with several golden brown
doughnuts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here we are,&#8221; he said, triumphantly. &#8220;Now
to enjoy the radio!&#8221;</p>
<p>Herb had brought a pair of ear phones with
him, and he and Jimmy connected their phones
in series, so that they could both listen at the same
time.</p>
<p>They had hardly got settled when they heard
the resonant tones of the announcer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Robert Layton will ask a number of conundrums,
the answers to come later.&#8221; So spoke
the announcer.</p>
<p>Herb and Jimmy gazed at each other open-mouthed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wh-what did he say?&#8221; gasped Jimmy, at
length. &#8220;Did you hear it the same as I did,
Herb?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He said Robert Layton, all right!&#8221; exclaimed
Herb. &#8220;What do you suppose&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; But here he
was interrupted by the well known voice of their
friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;Give me a pencil!&#8221; exclaimed Herb. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
guess those before the answers come, or die trying.
We can&#8217;t let Bob get away with this altogether.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say not!&#8221; agreed Jimmy, as Herb
started scribbling furiously. &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe yet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
that it&#8217;s really Bob talking. How do you suppose
he ever got on the programme?&#8221;</p>
<p>Herb shook his head without stopping his writing,
and at last had all the riddles written down.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind the rest of the programme,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll try to solve these things first.&#8221;</p>
<p>But while they were still struggling to find answers
to the knotty riddles, they nearly went over
backward in their chairs as another familiar name
sounded in their ears. The announcer was giving
Joe&#8217;s name this time, and all Herb and Jimmy
could do was to sit and look at each other and
mutter inarticulately as Joe recited his selections.
When they were over, both boys took off their
head phones and gazed solemnly at each other.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you beat it?&#8221; asked Herb at length, in a
bewildered way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nope,&#8221; responded Jimmy. &#8220;I&#8217;m not even going
to try. Just think of those two Indians actually
getting on a broadcasting programme! I&#8217;m
knocked so hard that I&#8217;ll have to eat another
doughnut to set me straight again. Finish &#8217;em
up, Herb.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Herb &#8220;finished &#8217;em up&#8221; while they both
ruminated on the incomprehensible vagaries of
fate.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got to go over and see &#8217;em do it,&#8221; declared
Jimmy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Right you are,&#8221; returned his chum. &#8220;I won&#8217;t
believe it till I see it with my own eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>They saw it with their own eyes a week later
when the radio boys gave a second performance
which was even more successful than the first,
since they had got over the nervousness that affected
them at the start. The manager renewed
his importunities for them to take a regular engagement,
assuring them that they had made a
decided hit. The best the boys could see their
way clear to agree to, however, was to appear one
night in each week, and this programme was
carried out for the several weeks ensuing, with
ever-increasing ability on the part of Bob and Joe
and marked satisfaction to the manager of the
sending station.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>SOLVING THE MYSTERY</h3>
</div>

<p>One night after another performance all of the
radio boys were waiting in the railroad station
when Larry, who had stepped to the news stand
to buy a paper, came hurrying back to where
they were sitting.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve spotted the men who ran me down in
the motor boat!&#8221; he gasped. &#8220;They&#8217;re talking together
over in that corner!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure?&#8221; asked Bob, as he looked in
the direction indicated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dead sure,&#8221; declared Larry. &#8220;The look I had
at them as the motor boat was making for me is
engraved on my memory so that I couldn&#8217;t forget
it if I wanted to. Now&#8217;s the chance to get those
fellows jugged. You know the police were looking
for them after they ran us down and there&#8217;s
a warrant out for their arrest. The police didn&#8217;t
have their names, so the warrant read for John
Doe and Richard Roe. We&#8217;ve got to act quickly,
as they may get up to take a train at any minute.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Keep your eye on them while I get a station
policeman,&#8221; admonished Bob, as he hurried off.</p>
<p>He found the officer, who listened attentively
as he told his story. Then he walked with Bob
toward the men who were still engaged in earnest
conversation.</p>
<p>As the officer&#8217;s eyes fell upon them, he gave a
start.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Red Pete and Bud McCaffrey, two of
the oldest crooks in the business,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;They&#8217;re wanted for more things than that affair
of yours. It will be a feather in my cap if I
gather them in.&#8221;</p>
<p>He tightened his grip on the club as he came
close to the two men. They looked up at him,
and a startled look came into their eyes as they
saw his uniform.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Pete. Hello, McCaffrey,&#8221; he greeted
them. &#8220;I guess you&#8217;d better come right along to
headquarters. The Chief would like to have a
talk with you.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a snarl the men leaped to their feet and
sought to get past the officer. He was too quick
for one of them, whom he grabbed by the collar
and reduced to submission by two cracks with his
club. The other eluded him, however, and promised
to make good his escape. But quick as a
flash Bob thrust out his foot and tripped him,
at the same time falling upon him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span></p>
<p>The fall knocked the breath out of the fugitive,
and Bob had no trouble in holding him until Joe
and the other boys came up, together with another
policeman, who had been attracted by the fracas.
A patrol wagon was summoned and the prisoners
were conveyed to the nearest police station, where
they and the bags they had carried were searched
in the presence of the boys, who had missed their
train in order to be present and give what information
they could about the motor boat
affair.</p>
<p>The bags were found to contain, among jewelry
and other things that were apparently the proceeds
of robberies, a number of pawntickets calling
for stickpins, watches and other articles which
the police lieutenant at the desk announced would
be looked up by some of his men. The prisoners
were locked up to await a court examination, and
the boys, after having given their names and addresses
in case they were wanted later on as witnesses,
left for home in a state of high excitement
over the stirring events of the night.</p>
<p>Bob kept in touch with the case, and a few days
later came rushing up to his friends in high glee.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think, fellows?&#8221; he announced.
&#8220;After the extra performance I gave to-day at the
broadcasting station, I dropped in at the police
station and had a look at some of the loot the
police had gathered up on the strength of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
pawntickets. And among them what do you think
I saw?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Crown Jewels of England,&#8221; guessed
Herb.</p>
<p>Bob withered him with a look.</p>
<p>&#8220;The stickpins and watches of Buck Looker
and Carl Lutz!&#8221; announced Bob impressively.
&#8220;Their initials were on the watches.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Glory be!&#8221; cried Larry, who was present.
&#8220;That clears me in that matter. I know none of
you fellows believed Buck&#8217;s dirty fling, but all
the same I&#8217;ve felt uncomfortable ever since.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you&#8217;ll get a nice letter of apology from
Mr. Buck Looker&mdash;I don&#8217;t think,&#8221; remarked Joe.</p>
<p>The information was conveyed to Buck and
Lutz, and they identified and recovered their property.
But as Joe had predicted, not a word of
apology for their unfounded charges was received
from either one of the pair.</p>
<p>Not long afterward the arrested men were convicted
and sentenced to long prison terms. It developed
that they were old offenders who made
a specialty of robbery at summer resorts.</p>
<p>Larry grew steadily better and there was every
prospect that his lameness would in time wholly
disappear. But he was doing so well at the broadcasting
station that he determined to give up any
further idea of vaudeville and devote himself to
radio, going to a technical school in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
meantime to perfect his education. Tim steadily advanced
in his chosen vocation, and the boys
heard from him frequently. No one rejoiced
more than they when they learned that he was at
last in the big-time circuit.</p>
<p>During all these events the boys had been busy
at developing the receiving set, and at last it was
finished to their satisfaction. In the course of
their work they gathered a large amount of familiarity
with radio which proved of immense
value later on, as will be seen in the next volume
of this series, entitled: &#8220;The Radio Boys at
Mountain Pass; Or, The Midnight Call For Assistance.&#8221;</p>
<p>The special set that represented the advance
they had made in radio reception included the regenerative
principle. This feature added immensely
to the sensitiveness of the set. It consisted
of a coil, variously known as the tickler, the
intensity coil, and the regeneration coil. It involved
three controls, the wave-length tuning, the
regenerative coil, and the filament rheostat. The
result of the combination was not only that the
radio frequency waves could be carried over into
the plate circuit, but that they could be amplified
there by the energy derived from the local battery
in the plate circuit without change of frequency
or wave form, and that they could be fed
into the grid circuit, where they increased the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
potential variations on the grid so that the operation
constantly repeated itself.</p>
<p>This &#8220;feed-back&#8221; regeneration enormously increased
the loudness of the receiving signals, and
its value to the boys was demonstrated one night
when the air was unusually free of static and they
clearly heard the signals from Nauen, Germany,
and the Eiffel Tower, Paris. They looked at each
other incredulously at first, and then as they heard
the signals again too certainly to admit of doubt,
they jumped to their feet, clapped each other on
the shoulder, and fairly went wild with delight.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first boys in this old town to pick up a
message from Europe!&#8221; cried Joe. &#8220;What next?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Asia perhaps,&#8221; suggested Jimmy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then Australia,&#8221; ventured Herb.</p>
<p>&#8220;Or Mars,&#8221; predicted Bob. &#8220;Who knows?&#8221; he
added, as he saw the smile of doubt on his comrades&#8217;
faces. &#8220;Marconi thought he might, and
he&#8217;s no dreamer. What is impossible to radio?&#8221;</p>
